The Neill-Cochran House Museum is an antebellum home in the heart of central Austin that is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Built in 1828, this antebellum house was once home to enslaved people. The museum's mission is to incorporate this history into the narrative of the museum and the city of Austin. The museum has several rotating exhibits and offers a membership benefit for visitors. It is located at 2310 San Gabriel St, Austin, TX 78705.

During the school year, educators can use the Neill-Cochran House Museum as a classroom, or as a resource for home-schooling families. There is also an excellent curriculum available for teachers and parents, and you can download it for free online. The museum offers family programming twice a month, such as Sunday Funday, which includes hands-on activities, scavenger hunts, self-paced tours, and lawn games. The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 11am to 4pm.

One of Austin's hidden gems is the Neill-Cochran House Museum, which is close to the University of Texas campus. This 1855 antebellum home has survived neglect, war, and the enormous growth of the capital city. The museum is the ideal place to take the whole family. There are events for kids to learn about the history of Austin, and even take a class or two.

During the 1840s, the Neill-Cochran family owned this estate and had enslaved people work for them. Slave quarters were often closer to the main house, and this project will celebrate the contributions of these formerly enslaved people. While most people associate slavery with plantations, this was not the case. In fact, the Neill-Cochran House Museum in Austin was one of 15 freedmen's communities in the city.

The Neill-Cochran House Museum is one of the most treasured sites in the city. Originally a mansion for a Texas Governor, it has a fascinating history. It has served as a hospital and school, and has survived many tumultuous periods in Austin's history. It is one of the few antebellum historic homes that is open to the public.

Neill-Cochran House Museum hosts special events and speaker series. The museum is also an excellent place to host a family event. In addition to hosting monthly children's events, the museum also hosts special exhibits, such as an Anna Stanley exhibition. Marni Holbrook Roberson's paintings are displayed in the museum. They are on display through December 21. The museum also hosts a monthly speaker series.
