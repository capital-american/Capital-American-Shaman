If you're a history buff, the Bullock Texas State History Museum is definitely worth a visit. It is located at 1800 Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78701. The museum is home to three floors of exhibit space and will keep you engrossed for hours. Pop culture junkies can also find a lot to love here. It's a must-see, and even if you're not into history, the museum will provide the perfect dose of the local culture.

The Bob Bullock Museum was dedicated to the life and legacy of former Texas Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock. The museum was built for $80 million by the state legislature and broke ground in 1999. It opened on April 21, 2001, on the 165th anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto, which ended the Texas Revolution. The museum houses a permanent exhibition of his life, as well as a collection of his works.

The state capitol in Austin is the centerpiece of Texas politics. The state capitol is a National Historic Landmark and stands fourteen feet taller than the US Capitol in Washington D.C. The capitol is free to visit and is surrounded by lush gardens. However, the tour might be overcrowded during peak times, so plan ahead to avoid crowds. For a truly informative experience, plan to spend at least two hours at the capitol.

Visitors can learn about the state's rich history through interactive exhibits. The Story of Texas Museum features an IMAX screen, the state's largest in the region, and proceeds from the screenings go towards upkeep of the museum. During the day, visitors can enjoy a movie in the Texas Spirit Theater, including the multi-sensory "Star of Destiny." The museum also has nighttime films in the form of B Movies and other cult classics. Guests can also dine in the museum's Story of Texas Cafe, which emphasizes fresh ingredients and local sourcing.

For families, a trip to the Bob Bullock Museum will provide a family-friendly experience. The museum has over 500 artifacts relating to the city's history. The museum also features IMAX movies and a gift shop. Educational programs are offered year-round at the museum, and it offers free admission on the first Sunday of every month. In addition to the museum, families can also visit Zilker Metropolitan Park, where there's plenty to do.

Another family attraction is the Blanton Museum of Art, which is located on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The university is home to several top tourist attractions. The Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art houses a permanent collection of 17,000 works of art and hosts many temporary exhibits. While the museum isn't the largest, it's certainly a fun place to visit. Its newest exhibit, "Redbud," showcases the city's culture.

If you have a few free hours, you might want to visit Mayfield Park and Preserve, located five miles north of downtown Austin. It is free to visit and open from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. You can't bring pets to the park, but it is worth the visit. If you have a dog, make sure it's on a leash when you're in the park.
