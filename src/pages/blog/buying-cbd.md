## 5 Things to Know before buying CBD Products

CBD or cannabidiol is on its rise to popularity as a health supplement.  Extracted from the cannabis or hemp plant, CBD which does not contain any psychoactive properties has been found to have a wide range of health benefits from pain relief to fighting anxiety.  Purchasing CBD products can often be a daunting task.  With multiple players in the market today, many of who do not adhere to quality standards, it could be an onerous task for an average buyer to filter which products are safe and pure for consumption.  However, there are a couple of important things you can keep in mind while purchasing CBD products.  Equipping yourself with this knowledge can help you choose the safest and most effective products without worry.

## 1.  Third Party Lab Tests

One of the most important pieces of information that you should have access to while buying a CBD product is third party lab tests.  Always check whether the products have been tested independently for safety and purity.  These tests ensure that the goods produced are of high quality and are consistent.

Third party test reports help you to ensure that the product contains ingredients as has been claimed in the label.  They also certify that it contains no harmful chemicals, solvents, microbes and pesticides.

Make sure to check if the tests have been carried out by an accredited laboratory.  While analysing the lab report, cross check whether the cannabinoid concentration specified in the label matches what is stated in the report.

## 2. THC Content

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the compound in cannabis that makes you high.  CBD products are legally required to have less than 0.3% THC in most states.  On the other hand, in certain states, products containing higher traces of THC are legal.  To ensure the legality of the CBD products you are buying, make sure you check the laws in your area concerning THC concentration.  A concentration of less than 0.3% of THC is however, widely accepted as legal and can ensure that the CBD product you buy is free from any psychoactive properties.  CBD Products with 0% THC are either CBD isolate or Broad Spectrum.  For more information on the different types of CBD products please take a look at our blog about Full vs Broad vs Isolate.

## 3. Organically Grown Hemp

As a bioaccumulator, hemp can absorb everything in its environment and can transmit it to your body when you consume CBD.  Ensuring that the CBD is extracted from hemp that has been organically grown is very important.

It is possible for hemp to be exposed to toxic chemicals, herbicides, or heavy metals if it isn't grown organically.  These will be absorbed by the plant and could potentially be passed on to you.

Organic hemp farms usually use cultivation methods that ensure high-quality, pure goods.  Maintaining the correct PH-balanced soil, sourcing hemp seeds from certified collectives, and avoiding pesticides, GMOs, and other chemicals are a few of these pracitces.

## 4. Specialised Extraction Process

Highly specialized extraction and bioavailability processes can guarantee that the CBD products you intend to buy are of top quality.  There are various common ways through which CBD is extracted from the hemp plant.

CO2 extraction which uses pressurized carbon dioxide to extract CBD is considered one of the most superior methods of extraction.  Products made from CBD extracted in this way are pure, safe and high quality. 

## 5. Type of CBD Product

Full Spectrum, Broad Spectrum and CBD Isolate are some of the most common types of CBD products available in the market. What do these really mean?

This differentiation usually reflects changes in the cannabinoid extraction process.  CBD isolate is a 99% pure CBD extract that is isolated from all other cannabinoids.  It does not contain any additional phytochemicals and terpenes.

Full Spectrum CBD preserves all naturally occurring plant cannabinoids, including some minimal legally permitted traces of THC.  Broad Spectrum CBD is a mix of both CBD isolate and full spectrum CBD.  Full spectrum products are usually preferred by many since they provide you with the wholesome benefits of plant cannabinoids beyond just CBD.
