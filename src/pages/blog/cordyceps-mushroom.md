## What are Cordyceps mushrooms?

Cordyceps are a type of fungus that has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries. Cordyceps grow naturally in the wild but can also be cultivated in laboratories.

The caterpillar fungus is another name for the cordyceps fungus. Its parasitic nature is evident because it develops on a specific type of caterpillar before devouring the host. However, some species can grow on other types of fungi or even on the ground.

The mushroom's dark brown to black base, which grows to be about six inches long and attaches to the living host, originates from the insect's larva. It eats more than 90% of the diseased insect when fully grown.

Then, these mushrooms swell and grow, gaining between 300 and 500 milligrams in weight.

When cordyceps were discovered, people first noticed animals consuming the wild mushroom and gaining strength. The fungus was first used by farmers and herders to prepare tonics and teas from its powder form.

The early applications for these tonics included boosting milk output and enhancing cattle reproduction. Later, to maintain the potency of cordyceps, people started drying them in the sun.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, cordyceps are often used to treat various ailments, including respiratory problems, fatigue, and kidney disease. They are also believed to have anti-aging and anti-cancer properties.

Cordyceps are widely available in various supplement forms, including capsules, powders, and tinctures.

## Benefits of the Cordyceps Mushroom

**Boost Exercise Performance**

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is[necessary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28094746)for supplying muscle energy, is produced by the body frequently when cordyceps are consumed.

This might enhance how your body utilizes oxygen, particularly when exercising.

In one[study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02836405)using a stationary bike, researchers examined their effects on 30 healthy older persons' exercise ability. In contrast to those who received the placebo, those who had taken CS-4 by the end of the experiment had shown an increase in VO2 (fitness level measuring unit) max of 7%.

Exercise performance measurements in older and younger persons have been demonstrated to be improved by cordyceps but not in highly trained athletes.

**Anti-Aging Benefits**

Historically, cordyceps have been used by the elderly to increase their sexual appetite, increase strength, and combat fatigue.

Its antioxidant concentration, according to[researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433838), may account for its anti-aging properties.

According to several types of research, cordyceps help[improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18803231)cognition and[sexual function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21061463)in old mice by raising[antioxidant levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536281).

**Potential Anti-Cancer Effects**

Cordyceps have shown promising potential as a natural[anti-cancer agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26115996/). Several in vitro studies have suggested that cordyceps extract may help block the growth and spread of various types of[cancer cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26115996/), including those of the liver,[lung](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26263965/), and[colon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26141646/).

Furthermore, cordyceps may also offer benefits for those undergoing cancer treatment. Animal studies have shown that cordyceps could potentially reduce the risk of[leukopenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775070/), a condition that can arise from chemotherapy or radiation and can result in a decrease in white blood cells, which can increase the risk of infection and illness.

While these findings are promising, more research is needed to fully understand the potential anti-cancer effects of cordyceps in humans. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional before using cordyceps as a complementary therapy for cancer treatment.

**May Help Manage Blood Sugar**

Cordyceps contains two key ingredients, d-mannitol cordycepin and 3’-deoxyadenosine. These have been found to contribute to the mushroom's ability to help regulate insulin and blood sugar levels.

Animal studies have shown that cordyceps supplements may effectively control high blood sugar levels and reduce insulin levels, which could potentially protect against insulin resistance. These findings suggest that cordyceps may benefit those with type 2 diabetes or other conditions related to insulin resistance.

**Heart Health**

Cordyceps may benefit heart health due to its potential ability to help lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol levels, and improve blood flow.

Animal[studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814030/)have found that cordyceps supplements can help lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and increasing blood flow. This effect may be due to[adenosine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23192916/), a compound that can dilate blood vessels and improve circulation.

Additionally, some studies have suggested that cordyceps can help[reduce cholesterol levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21882527)by decreasing the production of cholesterol in the liver and increasing cholesterol excretion from the body. This could potentially lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Overall, while more research is needed to understand the potential benefits of cordyceps for heart health fully, these initial findings suggest that cordyceps may be a promising natural supplement for those looking to support cardiovascular health.

**May Help Fight Inflammation**

Cordyceps have been shown to have potential benefits for immune function, as well as the health of several different bodily systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and reproductive systems.

One reason for these potential benefits is the presence of[anti-inflammatory compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909570/), including polysaccharides, modified nucleosides, and cyclosporine, which may help reduce inflammation in the body.

Research has suggested that cordyceps may be particularly beneficial for those with inflammatory-related conditions, such as Crohn's disease, arthritis, leaky gut, and asthma. One animal[study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19133568/)showed that cordyceps was effective at reducing inflammation in the airways of mice, potentially offering benefits for those with asthma.

## How to Use Cordyceps?

Cordyceps can be consumed in various supplement forms, including capsules, powders, and tinctures. The appropriate dosage and form of cordyceps may vary depending on the individual and their specific health goals. However, typically 1,000–3,000 mg per day is a good bet as many researchers on humans use it.

As with any supplement, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before using it. They can help determine the appropriate dosage and form of cordyceps based on your needs and health status.

**Here are some general guidelines for using cordyceps:**

1. Choose a high-quality cordyceps supplement from a reputable manufacturer.
2. Follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage instructions carefully.
3. Cordyceps can be taken with or without food, depending on your preference.
4. Cordyceps powder can be mixed into smoothies, juices, or other beverages.
5. Cordyceps tinctures can be taken directly under the tongue or mixed into water or another beverage.
6. It's essential to be consistent with your use of cordyceps to experience its potential benefits.
7. Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any supplement, including cordyceps.
