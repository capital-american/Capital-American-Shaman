## Everything You Need To Know About Terpenes in CBD Flower.

Over the years, medical marijuana users have paid more attention to CBD and THC (the two most prominent cannabinoids in cannabis) due to the benefits they offer.  However, in recent times, terpenes are slowly growing in popularity not just because of their euphoric effects, but a lot of people have also realized that they offer relief to various types of disorders. 

### What are Terpenes?

Used widely in perfumes, fragrances, and other medical purposes, terpenes are scented oil secreted from the cannabis plant that also produces THC and CBD.  Terpenes come from the secretory cell of the cannabis trichomes.  They are mostly found in unfertilized female cannabis flowers.  Terpenes play an incredible role in providing the plant with natural protection from bacteria, insects and environmental stress.   Like other cannabinoids, terpenes work with receptors in the human body to give an array of effects that boost energy and enhance mood.  At present, there are over 100 terpenes that provide unique flavors ranging from herbal, sweet, fruity, sour, pine, and many more.  The awesomeness of terpenes doesn't stop here; research has also proven that they provide relief to people suffering from disorders like cancer, depression, nausea, muscle strain, stress, and other forms of ailment. 

### Molecules in Terpenes.

Terpenes are used to describe a large class of chemical compounds that affects smell and flavor.  Their molecules can be subdivided into two, which are:

•	**Monoterpenes:** These are lightweight terpenes like myrcene, terpinolene, and limonene, responsible for the floral scents that you get from the cannabis plant.

•	**Sesquiterpenes:** These are heavyweight terpenes like humulene and caryophyllene, which are responsible for the stronger scents that the cannabis plant produces. 

### Effects and Benefits of Terpenes.

In looking at the benefits and effects of terpenes, it is vital to take a look at the different types of terpenes, the effect they offer, and their medical benefits.

**•	Limonene:** This is a monoterpene found in topical marijuana varieties like Jack Herer and Pineapple Express.  Limonene is known for its depression-fighting properties.  They can also be used in treating symptoms associated with cancer, weight gain, and bronchitis.  These terpenes are often used as a significant flavoring in beverages and topical cannabis products like skin ointment and creams. 

**•	Myrcene:** Known for its anti-insomnia properties, myrcene makes up over 20% of total terpenes in the cannabis plant.  It is perfect for medical cannabis users suffering from sleep disorders and ulcers due to its antispasmodic, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic properties.  Myrcene is also known for its beer fragrance; the aroma ranges from fruity, earthy, and musky.  This terpene is found in popular cannabis strains like OG Kush, and AK-47 and they offer a more significant psychoactive effect. 

**•	Linalool:** The second most essential terpene found in the cannabis plant is Linalool, which gives a floral scent just like lavender.

### How to care for your Terpenes

To enjoy all the benefits that terpenes have to offer, you need to take extra care of them.  One of the important ways to care for your terpenes and ensure they remain fresh properly is by using is a tight glass jar that keeps air out.  In addition, ensure that they are stored in a safe and cozy environment to avoid too much moisture that causes mildew to assemble on them. 

### Are terpenes legal?

Terpenes are legal for use; in fact, the FDA has approved the use of terpenes by medical and recreational cannabis users.  Terpenes are produced by almost all plants; this implies that if they are illegal, lemons, perfumes, bouquets, and so many items used on a daily basis also become illegal.  The fact that terpenes are widely accepted and legal is still of tremendous importance to their success. Whether you add them to your bath, use as flavors, and consume to cure a medical condition, terpenes offer so many benefits. 

### CBD Flower vs Marijuana

A lot of cannabis users find it quite challenging to differentiate between CBD flower and marijuana due to their similarities. CBD flower is a product of the hemp plant which is of the Cannabis Sativa family. However, in marijuana, you will find the strain of both Indica and Sativa.

The major difference between CBD flower and marijuana can be seen in the type of effect they produce.  For people who have personal reservation about getting high while taking CBD for medical purpose, their best option is to opt for CBD flower that provides health benefits without getting you high.  In contrast to marijuana, CBD flower doesn't affect your ability to carry out a cognitive task, and you can also experience a deep feeling of relaxation after dosing.  Marijuana is the best option for cannabis users who can’t function daily without the influence of THC; it provides a feeling of high and can sometimes affect your mental health. 

### Conclusion

Finally, the use of cannabis is gaining increased popularity all over the world due to the immense benefits that it offers; however, there are so many legal issues associated with its use. At present, only a few countries like the United States and Canada have approved the use of CBD for medical purposes, while so many others put a lot of restrictions on its use. However, the use of terpenes is legal for both medical and recreational cannabis users. Due to this, so many cannabis companies are leveraging on the benefits it offers in creating terpenes infused products with no legal hassles even though people buy these products due to their association with cannabis.
