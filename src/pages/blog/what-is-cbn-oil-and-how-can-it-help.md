# CBN OIL

CBN stands for cannabinol, which is one of the chemical compounds found in cannabis and hemp plants. Distinct from cannabidiol (CBD) or cannabigerol (CBG) oil, CBN oil is increasingly gaining popularity due to its promising health benefits.

CBN Oil, much like CBD or CBG do not contain THC, the compound in cannabis that makes you high. This makes CBN safe and healthy for consumption.

## CBN and CBD – What’s the Difference?

Cannabis and hemp plants have a wide range of cannabinoids in them. CBD is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in the cannabis plant. Manufacturers can hence breed cannabis plants to have a higher CBD content. 

On the other hand, CBN is produced by the breakdown of THC and the content of CBN cannot be altered by manufacturers.

Though both originate from cannabis or hemp, there is much less information on CBN currently. There is not enough research on the variety of benefits that CBN has to offer when compared to CBD. As a result, CBN is less widely available than CBD.

## Benefits of CBN 

CBN is widely known as a sleep aid or a sedative. It is also shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and helps in pain relief.

Research also shows that CBN has neuroprotective properties and helps control the immune system and alleviate pain and inflammation associated with a number of conditions, including arthritis and Crohn's disease.

Glaucoma-related intraocular eye pressure may be reduced, according to studies. Since CBN is an anticonvulsant, it is also helpful to patients with seizure disorders.
