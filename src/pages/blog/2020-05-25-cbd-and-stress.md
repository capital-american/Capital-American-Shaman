In addition to going over the CBD's effects, and the root of stress, we’ll also explore the best ways to use CBD to manage the stress levels we encounter daily.  This will provide insight and knowledge on how to utilize hemp most effectively.

**Dissecting stress**

What exactly is stress?  Stress is a chemical reaction that occurs within our hormonal system.  In ancient times our ancestors relied on stress response to keep them clear of danger.  Our minds secrete cortisol, a hormone that stimulates the nervous system when in the bloodstream.  This helps us think faster and respond quicker to avoid danger.  Stress helped our ancestors survive.  The stress response evokes a series of chemical changes which increases our heart rate, deprioritizes digestion, cause our minds to have racing thoughts and cause our muscles to tense up.  These side effects that once helped us, seem to hinder more than help in today’s society.  Life has changed drastically from ancient times.

**Dealing with Stress**

There are many ways to deal with stress, some techniques are more useful than others.  Many people use meditation, yoga and many other practices in an attempt to calm the mind, but not everyone has time to carry out these practices daily.  Some people utilize a professional therapist for help with limiting their stress.

**CBD lowers Stress: What Research Tells Us.**

How does CBD fit into the equation that yields our stress levels?  CBD and other hemp cannabinoids work with our body’s endocannabinoid system.  Our endocannabinoid system uses cannabinoid receptors to produce chemical changes which can regulate bodily functions such as hormonal secretion and mood.

CBD is a natural, plant-derived product that can be purchased over the counter and is sometimes blended with other stress-relieving plant-based alternatives such as lavender, kava and other herbs & botanicals.  Many people use CBD daily to alleviate stress.

**How You Can Start Using CBD**

The first thing we recommend to everyone is that they consult with their doctor prior to implementing a CBD regimen.  It is always good for your doctor to know what you are putting in your body, whether it comes from a plant or not.

We recommend that you choose a strength that is catered to you as an individual.  Higher strengths of CBD are more potent, and you will know the potency level that is ideal for you based on how you feel.  It is always better to start off with a lower strength and increase potency vs starting off stronger and decreasing as needed.

One key aspect to using CBD is consistency.  Due to the nature of the endocannabinoid system, it seems best to use CBD daily.  This allows the compounds to build up gradually in the system, potentially making it more efficient and more effective.  You can start with the suggested dosage found on the product label.  You can increase your daily dose as needed over the course of a few weeks if you feel it’s necessary.

The manner you choose to consume CBD is your decision.  CBD can be [vaped](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/msterling-leach), [ingested](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/msterling-leach) or applied via sublingual administration as a [tincture](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/msterling-leach).
