# D﻿elta 8 gummies in Austin

Products derived from hemp are increasingly becoming popular, thanks to the multitude of benefits they offer our body.  You'll find a variety of ways to consume cannabinoids, from vapes and oils, to sweets like chocolate and gummies.  While CBD has been one of the most popular compounds from cannabis or hemp, but there is a new kid on the block that is becoming increasingly popular, Delta-8 THC.

Delta-8 THC is commonly extracted/derived from hemp as opposed to Delta-9 THC which comes from cannabis.  It's a less psychoactive and more therapeutic version of Delta-9 THC (marijuana).  Compared to Delta-9 THC, Delta8 THC is found to have a more relaxing and calming effect on the body.  Delta-8 THC can be consumed in a variety of ways, and gummies are one of the most popular in the list.  Delta-8 gummies come in a variety of flavors and is one of the easiest and most effective ways to ingest Delta-8 THC. 

## What are the potential benefits of Delta-8 gummies?

Delta-8 THC has been shown in studies to lower anxiety, relax the body's stress response, boost mood and motivation, boost appetite, and in many cases provide pain relief.

•	Anti-nauseant properties

The anti-nausea properties of Delta-8-THC were described in a [1995 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002432059500194B?via%3Dihubhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002432059500194B?via%3Dihub) published in the journal "Life Sciences".  The study followed eight juvenile cancer patients for a year and discovered that they did not vomit after eating Delta-8-THC before and after their cancer treatment.  The study discovered that Delta-8 THC almost completely stopped the nausea caused by chemotherapy. 

•	Could Stimulate Appetite 

Several studies have proven the appetite stimulating properties of Delta-8 THC.  When researchers gave mice a low dose of Delta-8-THC over 50 days, the results showed a 22 percent increase in food intake compared to controls, according to research published in the 2004 edition of "Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior".  When compared to delta-9-THC, delta-8-THC boosted food consumption considerably, according to the study.   

 •	Anxiety reducing potential

Delta-8-THC, like delta-9-THC, has potential anxiety-relieving properties, according to the [US National Library of Medicine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/delta8-THC).  Delta-8-THC ingestion helps relax and calm the mind, without the anxiety that users sometimes experience when consuming cannabis.

Delta-8 THC binds with CB1 and CB2 receptors in the body.  The cannabinoid's capacity to bind is what allows it to persuade the body to better manage pain and anxiety.

•	Anti-inflammatory properties

Delta-8 THC has strong analgesic properties, like other cannabis products.  These properties can potentially help in providing relief from pain and inflammation.  Delta-8 THC is found to be particularly effective in pain relief in the gastrointestinal tract.
