Products derived from hemp are increasingly becoming popular, thanks to the multitude of benefits they offer our body. You'll find a variety of ways to consume cannabinoids, from vapes and oils to sweets like chocolate and gummies. While CBD has been one of the most popular compounds from cannabis or hemp, a new kid on the block is increasingly becoming popular- Delta 8 THC.

Delta-8 THC is commonly extracted/derived from hemp as opposed to Delta-9 THC which comes from cannabis. It's a less psychoactive and more therapeutic version of Delta-9 THC (marijuana). Compared to Delta-9 THC, Delta8 THC is found to have a more relaxing and calming effect on the body. 
Delta-8 THC can be consumed in a variety of ways and gummies are one of the most popular in the list. Delta-8 gummies come in a variety of flavours and is one of the easiest and most effective ways to ingest Delta-8 THC. 

## 
What are the potential benefits of Delta-8 gummies?

 
Delta 8 THC has been shown in studies to lower anxiety, relax the body's stress response, boost mood and motivation, boost appetite, and in many cases provide pain relief.

•	Anti-nauseant properties

The anti-nausea properties of Delta-8-THC were described in a [1995 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002432059500194B?via%3Dihubhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002432059500194B?via%3Dihub) published in the journal "Life Sciences. "The study followed eight juvenile cancer patients for a year and discovered that they did not vomit after eating Delta-8-THC before and after their cancer treatment. The study discovered that Delta-8 THC almost completely stopped the nausea caused by chemotherapy. 

•	Could Stimulate Appetite 

Several studies have proven the appetite stimulating properties of Delta-8 THC. When researchers gave mice a low dose of Delta-8-THC over 50 days, the results showed a 22 percent increase in food intake compared to controls, according to research published in the 2004 edition of ‘Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior.' When compared to delta-9-THC, delta-8-THC boosted food consumption considerably, according to the study. While cannabis products are generally known to increase appetite, Delta-8 THC unlike other cannabis products, is found to have no side effects.

 •	Anxiety reducing potential

Delta-8-THC, like delta-9-THC, has potential anxiety-relieving properties, according to the [US National Library of Medicine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/delta8-THC). Delta-8-THC ingestion helps relax and calm the mind, without the anxiety that users sometimes experience when consuming cannabis.

 Delta-8 THC binds with CB1 and CB2 receptors in the body. The cannabinoid's capacity to bind is what allows it to persuade the body to better manage pain and anxiety.

•	Anti-inflammatory properties

 Delta-8 THC has strong analgesic properties, like other cannabis products. These properties can potentially help in providing relief from pain and inflammation. Delta-8 THC is found to be particularly effective in pain relief in the gastrointestinal tract.
