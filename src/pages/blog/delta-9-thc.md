# Delta 9 THCâ€”Everything You Need to Know

Do you know Hemp houses more than 400 compounds, among which two get most of the attention. Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) are the two stars of the hemp plant for good reason.

CBD and THC could potentially open up a world of health benefits for us upon consumption; however, the former is a non-toxic cannabinoid, and the latter is psychoactive. In other words, THC brings the euphoric effect often attributed to marijuana.

THC(Delta-9) has much more to offer than euphoria, and this article will discuss everything about this cannabinoid. So let's get to it:

## What is Delta 9 THC?

Tetrahydrocannabinol-THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis. THC is a cannabinoid that connects with your body to control many physiological processes. THC binds to brain receptors and activates neurotransmitters that affect mood, cognition, learning, coordination, and time perception. According to research and anecdotal evidence, THC can be beneficial in treating various medical conditions. Moreover, many individuals find it great for recreational activities since it offers pleasure and calmness.

## How does THC Work?

The Endocannabinoid system, or ECS, is a natural cell signaling mechanism in the human body. Endocannabinoids, receptors, and enzymes are the three main components of this system. The ECS operates similarly to a lock and key. To activate a bodily function, you need a specific lock (receptor) and a specific key (endocannabinoids).

Now consider that your body's CB1 and CB2 receptors exist, and THC activates the CB1 receptor by attaching to it. Your entire body, including the neurological system, contains the CB1 receptor. So, in other words, by connecting to CB1 receptors, THC can control your body's hunger, discomfort, inflammatory response, brain function, and memory functions.

## What are the benefits of Delta 9?

Despite THC being a psychoactive substance, it entails a plethora of benefits. Some medical benefits are revealed by scientists, while some are still unknown.

People often choose Delta 9 THC for its psychoactive effects but as more studies are released, the health benefits of compounds found in hemp have been known to support various health functions in the body, including sleep, mood, and energy.  The beneficial effects continue as the molecular compound (also referred to as a 'cannabinoid') of Delta-9 interacts with the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the body's endocannabinoid system to produce the entourage effect which helps the body enter homeostasis.  This type of THC, along with other legal types such as Delta 8 THC, provides compounding benefits when multiple cannabinoids interact in the body.

## Is Delta 9 Legal?

Before 2018 THC was not allowed for consumption. But following the enactment of the 2018 United States Farm Bill, which legalized hemp and hemp products, Delta 9 hemp has been permitted on a federal level.

Every edible hemp product must fulfill the requirement that it must not contain more than 0.3% THC calculated on a dry weight basis to be allowed under the Farm Bill. So if you want to consume THC, remember that you can only take it in a legal circle if it has less than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis.

Moreover, you should also search for authentic cannabinoid vendors that sell products with a legal threshold of THC. American Shaman CBD is one such brand that goes toe to toe with the 2018 farm bill and provides high-quality legal cannabinoid products.

## How to use Delta 9 THC?

There are several ways to include delta-9 THC in your daily life. You will get several options, from edibles like gummies, chocolates, caramels, popcorn and honey sticks for coffee. It depends on personal preference and desired outcome of the cannabinoid. 

For example, if you consume an edible, it generally takes 45-90 mins for the onset of effects. On the other hand, sublingual administration of tinctures will induce the results within a few minutes.

But if you want fast onset of effects even with THC edibles, look no further than American Shaman. The licensed premium cannabis products of American Shaman are made from industrial hemp. And many of them also incorporate unique nanotechnology to hasten the commencement time and deliver the appropriate psychoactive properties.

Moreover, all the THC products of American shaman come with thorough guidelines for dosing. So just by reading the labels, you can understand how much THC you can use.

## What makes CBD and Delta 9 different from one another?

Both CBD and Delta 9 THC are naturally present in hemp plants and offer numerous benefits. However, the way both cannabinoids act with the endocannabinoid system is the major difference between them. Delta 9 THC will induce psychoactive effects, whereas CBD products will not give you a "high/stoned" feeling.  This all boils down to their varying interaction with the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
