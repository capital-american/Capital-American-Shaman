# **What is THCa?**

Before diving into the benefits of THCa pre-rolls, let’s first understand what THCa is.

**THCa**, or *tetrahydrocannabinolic acid*, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in raw hemp and cannabis plants. It is the precursor to THC, the well-known psychoactive compound in cannabis.

When THCa is heated, such as through smoking or vaping, it converts to THC and produces the psychoactive effects commonly associated with cannabis. However, when consumed in its raw form, THCa offers a range of potential therapeutic benefits without the psychoactive effects.

#### **What are THCa Pre-rolls?**

THCa pre-rolls are rolled joints or blunts that contain high levels of THCa. These pre-rolls are typically made with raw hemp or cannabis flower that has not been decarboxylated, meaning it has not been heated to convert THCa to THC.

#### **Benefits of THCa Pre-rolls:**
