**Hemp Oil vs. CBD Oil: The reason There Isn’t a Clear Answer**

Let’s first define each term.  Technically speaking, hemp oil is an oil derived from the hemp seeds, while it’s extremely rich in a variety of nutrients, it practically has no CBD content because CBD is found in other parts of the plant.  [CBD oil](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/cbd-oils) comes from the flowers, stalks, and leaves of the hemp plant.  CBD naturally occurs in these areas of the plant at a high volume.

Pretty straight forward right?  The issue is that these terms tend to be used interchangeably by CBD companies.  Many people would assume that as far as the CBD market is concerned, CBD oil refers to CBD isolate, while hemp oil refers to a hemp extract that contains CBD in addition to other naturally occurring plant compounds such as additional cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids.

The term “CBD” has become somewhat of a blanket term for any hemp oil product that contains CBD.  CBD is simply one compound in hemp that just happens to be the most prominent one.  Consumers often consider the term CBD to mean marijuana minus the THC, which is the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana an illegal substance.

When people are in search of CBD oil, they are not necessarily looking for just pure CBD.  Many are looking for a variety of hemp compounds.  For this reason, it is the responsibility of industry leaders like American Shaman, to educate consumers on the terminology they will come across as they  research CBD.

Due to certain limitations within the industry, companies feel they cannot use the term “CBD" oil.  The FDA has not started regulating CBD, although it has been approved as a CBD-based drug for epilepsy.  This complicates matters for CBD brands, as using particular terms can cause them to fall out of compliance with the FDA and/or state laws.

**Hemp Oil**

Technically hemp oil refers to an oil containing hemp extract which is derived from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of the plant material.  Naturally, hemp extract is rich in an array of compounds native to hemp including CBD and other cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids.

It is important to know the distinct difference between hemp and marijuana.  Both are plants belonging to the cannabis family, but the difference between the two is their compositions of chemical compounds.  Marijuana generally contains a high level of THC, the psychoactive compound that gets people high.  Hemp has 0.3% or less THC that naturally occurs, which defines why it’s legal and non-psychoactive.

**Hemp Seed Oil**

Hemp Seed oil is generally associated with food and is commonly used as a culinary ingredient.  It is found in many haircare and skincare products because it has moisturizing properties.  Hemp Seed oil is derived from the seeds of the hemp plant.  It contains a high level of omega fatty acids, as well as a significant amount of protein.  The seeds of the hemp plant do not contain cannabinoids or any of the other compounds that are commonly sought after in CBD products.

**What is CBD?**

Understanding CBD oil brings context to understanding CBD vs. hemp oil.  CBD is a cannabinoid found in the hemp plant.  Hemp naturally contains a variety of cannabinoids.  CBD is found in both the hemp and marijuana plants, but CBD and THC are inversely correlated.  The more THC (psychoactive), the less CBD (non-psychoactive) and vice versa.  So, CBD oil products are made from plants with high levels of CBD and trace amounts of THC.

CBD will not get you high, which is why it’s legal on a federal level and can be purchased throughout the United States.  A great deal of research has been conducted to study the unique properties of this cannabinoid, and as a result, many people take it daily for various health benefits.

**What is a CBD Isolate?**

Now, let’s bring CBD isolate into the discussion.  A lot of people assume CBD oil is CBD isolate, but this is not always the case.  CBD isolate is a crystalline powder that contains pure CBD only.  No other natural hemp compounds are found in CBD isolate.  It’s simply CBD combined with a carrier oil.  Being that it is pure CBD, it is free of THC.  That allows it to be legal even in states where trace amounts of THC are not legal.

**What is Full Spectrum Hemp Oil?**

Full spectrum hemp oil is an extract derived from the whole plant, meaning that it naturally contains the full spectrum of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids that exist in the plant material.  It’s the full chemical composition of hemp as it naturally occurs.  This is what most people are seeking when they are in search of CBD oil, since most folks want a completely natural product.

**What is Broad Spectrum Hemp Oil?**

Broad spectrum hemp oil is a [THC-free option](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/thc-free-cbd-oil) that by industry standards must contain at least two cannabinoids and one terpene.  This is in between full spectrum and CBD isolate, since it contains more than just CBD but not the full spectrum of compounds.

**Is Hemp Oil the Same as CBD Oil?**

So, CBD oil vs. hemp oil: is there a difference?  The answer is both yes and no.  Both terms overlap quite a bit, and it boils down to understanding the various industry terms to know what you’re getting when you purchase hemp-derived oil products.  Rather than focusing on the product names, read the product descriptions and ingredients to gain a better sense of what compounds are present in any CBD oil or hemp oil product.

**What are the Benefits of Hemp Oil?**

Hemp oil can provide some relief from mild discomfort, promote relaxation, help manage everyday stress, provide positive mental support, help improve mood, and provide some relief from occasional sleeplessness.  It can also help maintain cardiovascular function, help promote joint flexibility, and provide support to the immune system.

Humans have cannabinoid receptors throughout the brain and body which react to the endocannabinoids our bodies create.  The endocannabinoid system regulates many of our basic functions such as restfulness, relaxation, mood, hunger, joint function, the immune system, and cardiovascular function.  Cannabinoids from the hemp plant can help to keep these processes in balance by supplementing the body’s own endocannabinoids.

**Purchase Only From a Trustworthy Source**

It’s apparent, that the CBD oil vs. hemp oil subject is less cut and dry than you may have assumed.  The good news is that for the most part, companies are doing what they can to make a distinction between the two for the sake of transparency to consumers.  As long as you’re purchasing from a trustworthy source, you can easily apply this information to your next hemp purchase.
