## What is Delta 8?

Delta 8 is delta 8 THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  Delta 8 is not the same as delta 9 THC.  While delta 9 THC is known for being extremely potent in terms of its psycho active effects, delta 8 is only mildly psychoactive, being the result of degraded delta 9 that occurs in the cannabis plant.  Delta 8 is a cannabinoid derived from hemp, and being a cannabinoid, it offers more than psychoactive properties.  It is capable of binding with cannabinoid receptors in the nervous system to produce desirable regulatory effects, in a similar manner as CBD (cannabidiol).  Most people who use delta 8 describe the experience as relaxing and mood-enhancing, without interrupting one’s clarity of mind.

There are two different types of terpenes: botanical derived and cannabis-derived.  For a little more detail on "Terpenes" take a look at blog on terpenes[ here](https://capitalamericanshaman.com/blog/terpenes/).  

#### Botanical Derived Terpenes

These terpenes are sourced from plants other than cannabis and may also contain flavorings. They generally have a more artificial flavor/taste which can be a plus for people who dislike the earthiness of CDTs. They also tend to emit less fragrance than CDTs when used.

#### Cannabis Derived Terpenes

These terpenes are taken directly from the cannabis plant. CDTs tend to have a more potent smell and also a wider variety of compounds and terpenes in them than botanical-derived terpenes. This tends to be favorable to those in search of a more well-rounded “entourage effect” or a product that mimics the effect and feel of smoking cannabis
