# What Is Kratom?

Kratom is an herbal extract that comes from the leaves of an evergreen tree (Mitragyna speciosa) grown in Southeast Asia. It is in the family of the coffee plant.  Its leaves are dried and used in many forms.  It can be used to make tea, ground to powder, encapsulated and sold as a supplement. Kratom leaves can also be smoked like tobacco.  Kratom has been used for hundreds of years in Asia as a natural home remedy.

You can find kratom leaves, powder, and capsules in some health food stores, online specialty stores and vape shops.  It is commonly used to relieve pain, depression, and opioid addiction. The two most active compounds found in kratom are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which work on opioid receptors.  There is anecdotal evidence that these two alkaloids can have analgesic (pain relieving), anti-inflammatory, or muscle relaxing effects.

It is most often taken in the form of a powder that can be mixed in a drink, made into tea, put into capsules or taken dry and washed down with a drink. You can find fortified kratom powders, usually green or light brown in color. These powders also contain extracts from other plants. Consumers commonly report the effects of kratom as energizing, relaxing, pain relief, anxiety relief and euphoric.  These effects vary depending on the strain of Kratom being used. Because of these properties, it is becoming popular in the US as a natural alternative to prescription painkillers and is used by people coming off opiates to reduce withdrawal symptoms.
