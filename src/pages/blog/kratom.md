# What Is Kratom?

Kratom is an herbal extract that comes from the leaves of an evergreen tree (Mitragyna speciosa) grown in Southeast Asia.  It is in the family of the coffee plant.  Its leaves are dried and used in many forms.  It can be used to make tea, ground to powder, encapsulated and sold as a supplement.  Kratom leaves can also be smoked like tobacco.  Kratom has been used for hundreds of years in Asia as a natural home remedy.

You can find kratom leaves, powder, and capsules in some health food stores, online specialty stores and vape shops.  It is commonly used to relieve pain, depression, and opioid addiction.  The two most active compounds found in kratom are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which work on opioid receptors.  There is anecdotal evidence that these two alkaloids can have analgesic (pain relieving), anti-inflammatory, or muscle relaxing effects.

It is most often taken in the form of a powder that can be mixed in a drink, made into tea, put into capsules or taken dry and washed down with a drink.  You can find fortified kratom powders, usually green or light brown in color.  These powders also contain extracts from other plants.  Consumers commonly report the effects of kratom as energizing, relaxing, pain relief, anxiety relief and euphoric.  These effects vary depending on the strain of kratom being used.  Because of these properties, it is becoming popular in the US as a natural alternative to prescription painkillers and is used by people coming off opiates to reduce withdrawal symptoms.

## Kratom Strains

There are only 3 kratom strains but there are a lot of different kratom powders.  Each kratom powder has something unique to offer.

**Red Vein Kratom** – This is the most common strain of kratom.  It has red-colored veins in the leaves as well as red stems.  These kratom strains are often the most popular and many people buy this strain of kratom.  In low doses, it is a great relaxer as it produces tranquil effect.  It can provide a sense of well-being and is known for helping with sleep.

The Red Vein Kratom is known for its high potency of 7-hydroxy mitragynine, which has has been known for relieving pain and relaxing muscles.  That is the primary reason why Red Vein Kratom is mostly in use as a supplement for natural pain relief and a remedy to replace the pharmaceutical painkillers.

Red vein kratom is the kratom strain most often used for fighting opiate withdrawal.

**Green Vein Kratom** – With green veins spreading through the leaf’s surface as well as a green stem, green vein kratom strains often fall in between red vein and white vein.

Having properties of both these strains, green vein kratom is a mild stimulant, anti-depressant as well as an active energy booster that can brighten you up. Green Vein Kratom strain is an effective muscle relaxant as well as a non-sedating painkiller.

Some refer to the stimulation as subtle, calming, gradually increasing to a mild euphoria.  Green vein is sometimes referred to as the “social” kratom.  It has been known to help to ease tension but not over relaxing.  More often than not green vein kratom does not make you drowsy.

**White Vein Kratom** – White Vein types of Kratom is the strain with leaves having white-colored stems and veins.  This kratom strain is known for its mood enhancing effects and stimulation.  If you enjoy an opiate-like euphoria, white vein kratom comes closer to producing that effect than any other strain. Since it helps with stimulation, some kratom users enjoy white strains to help with anxiety and stress. People suffering from fatigue and sluggishness may find white vein kratom extremely helpful for attaining the energy they need, overcome exhaustion and enhance their overall mood.

## Why The Controversy Surrounding Kratom?

Kratom has not been studied in-depth by the medical community, so there are no official recommendations for any medical use.  Clinical studies/trials are extremely important for the development of any new drugs/substance.  These studies are a prerequisite to identifying harmful effects and adverse interactions with other drugs.  These studies also help in determining dosing guidelines that are optimal and safe to use.

Kratom can potentially have a strong effect on the body and may contain nearly as many alkaloids as hallucinogenic mushrooms and opium.  Alkaloids can have a strong physical effect on the human body, some of these effects can be positive, while others effects could be cause for serious concern.  This is why more studies on kratom are paramount.

Results from one animal study suggested that mitragynine, the major psychoactive alkaloid of kratom, may have addictive properties.  Dependence on kratom could potentially cause side effects such as sweating, nausea, tremors, inability to sleep, and hallucinations.  The production of kratom is not regulated by the FDA, there are no established standards for safely producing this product.
