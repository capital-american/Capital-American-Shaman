## Interested in CBD Capsules?

CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of many naturally occurring plant cannabinoids that is becoming increasingly popular for its health advantages.  CBD is derived from the hemp plant and is available in a variety of forms for consumption.  CBD products range from gummies and capsules to bath bombs and tinctures, giving consumers a variety of options.

CBD capsules can have active ingredients encapsulated either in its powdered form, or as softgels in combination with carrier oils like hemp or coconut oil.  They’re often the easiest way to ingest CBD.

## Benefits of CBD Capsules

CBD capsules are one of the most convenient ways to acquire your daily CBD dose, and they're a popular choice among both new and seasoned CBD users.  It can be tough to determine how much CBD you're getting while using CBD oils or CBD smokeables because the dosage is unknown.  This uncertainty vanishes with CBD capsules, and there's no need for you to measure or calculate how much CBD to consume every time you take a capsule.

Since CBD capsules are broken down by the digestive system and then absorbed into your body, it may take longer for the effects of CBD to set in your body unlike when you smoke CBD or use sublingual CBD. However, the effects of capsules are longer lasting than all other forms of CBD.  Capsules are also a tasteless way for you to consume CBD, if the taste of hemp bothers you, like it does for many.  It’s also convenient, handy and travel friendly and can be consumed anywhere at any time. 

## What does CBD do to your body?

CBD’s effects on the human body are primarily on the body’s endocannabinoid system that keeps many of our vital cycles in balance.  CBD boosts the optimal performance of the endocannabinoid system and can potentially help improve your overall wellbeing.

Consuming CBD capsules could possibly aid in anti-inflammatory response and pain relief.  It could help reduce anxiety, stress and improve clarity of thought and focus.  With several anti-oxidant properties, CBD capsules interact with serotonin in our bodies which could yield positive effects on our mood and thoughts.  Containing zero to less than 0.3% of THC, CBD capsules do not have any psychoactive properties that can get you high.
