# Interested in smoking CBD Flower?

Chances are you’ve seen ads or commercials for CBD oils, tinctures, and edibles but what about CBD flower and its products?  Top shelf, premium-grade hemp flower.  Smoking CBD bud is one of the fastest growing trends in the global CBD community.

What would make you want to smoke CBD flower?  Just to name a few we will outline some of the most popular reasons people frequent our store to check out our premier smokable CBD strains.

## CBD Flower has a Taste Many Love.

Smoking hemp flower would be less desirable if it weren’t for the unique terpene profiles each strain has.  Most customers agree that one of the main reasons they enjoy smoking hemp is that it tastes good.  Connoisseurs love experimenting with each of our flower strains to find the perfect profile for their palate.

## Entourage effect

Feel the effects of CBD hemp flower immediately.  CBD hemp flower is fast acting.  It works within seconds of your first hit, and you should experience the calming effects of CBD right away.  Since there is less than 0.3 percent THC in our hemp flower, there are no psychoactive effects experienced.  Most products like CBD oils and edibles must be processed by your liver.  This process takes a longer time and decreases the amount of CBD that makes its way into your bloodstream.  By smoking CBD flower, the Cannabidiol goes directly into your system.  Smoking hemp flower and vaping are the fastest ways of getting CBd into your system.

## The “Entourage Effect” can be felt.

The “entourage effect” is attributed to the high therapeutic potential the cannabinioids yield when consumed together.  This has been documented throughout cannabis research.  Hemp has its highest therapeutic potential when it is taken in its original form.  Although certain compounds might have benefits on their own, it seems hemp exerts its most substantial effects when taken with complementary compounds.

\
One of the easiest ways to take advantage of the entourage effect is to smoke hemp flower.  In addition to the benefits of CBD, the effects of terpenes, flavonoids, and lesser-known cannabinoids like CBN and CBG can be experienced.

## CBD Hemp Flower Can Help Those With Nicotine Addiction.

Some people smoke CBD hemp flower as an alternative to smoking tobacco.  The withdrawal symptoms of a nicotine addiction can be reduced by the soothing effects of CBD.  CBD flower can help to kick a cigarette habit.

## What Time Is Best To Smoke CBD Hemp Flower?

Truthfully there is not a recommended best time to smoke.  Some people who are new to hemp flower may wonder if it’s better to smoke in the morning or in the evening.  There really is no right or wrong answer.  What’s best is what works best for you.  Depending on the strain that you have, certain times could be more beneficial than others.

For example, many seasoned hemp users believe that the strain Lifter can be an excellent strain for mornings.  Partly because it leans far to the sativa side.  Lifter has a stimulating effect on  many smokers.  When making a decision on when to smoke your hemp flower, keep in mind some CBD strains could affect you differently than others.  Its also not uncommon for two people to have totally different experiences from the same substance.  Some people get sleepy after a tiny dose of CBD, while others might have a euphoric experience. 

Choosing the best time to smoke your hemp flower depends on a number of factors, the strain you use, the desired effect, your CBD tolerance, and your weight to name a few.  With patience and some experimentation, you can figure out what works for you.

## Can I Vape CBD Hemp Flower?

You can vape hemp flower in a dry-herb vaporizer.  Vaping the bud is the preferred method by many to experience each strain’s distinct terpene profile. 

If you are into vaporizing flower then there are a lot of options available.  There are high-quality convection and conduction units to choose from in stores.  There are products at every level with different pros and cons so it should not be difficult to find a model that’s right for you.

Vaping is considered a smoother and safer way to experience hemp flower.  People with pre-existing lung conditions or who are more prone to coughing usually find more pleasure from vaping versus firing up a joint.  Many prefer vaping over smoking because vaping is definitely more discrete.  A lot of vaporizers are small enough to fit in your pocket and the odor doesn’t hang around the way smoke does.  Vaping CBD flower is a stealthier approach to experiencing hemp flower than joints or cigarettes.

While there are advantages to vaping there are also some advantages to smoking.  You don’t have to deal with any contraptions.  Many people enjoy the flavor of smoking.  Vaping and smoking are two completely different experiences, they ultimately come down to personal preference.  Many people enjoy both methods depending on what they prefer at a particular place and time. 

## Not a Fan of the Taste of Smokable Hemp?

Sometimes hemp can be like wine.  It can be an acquired taste that is subject to change as you experience more and start to appreciate hemp’s unique flavor.  If it’s your first time purchasing CBD hemp flower, it is recommended to try and soak up as much information as you can about the strains and their descriptions.  Each strain is unique and there are even differences in the same strain grown by different farmers.  No two hemp strains are identical so it can take a bit of searching to find the ideal strain for you.

## Can You Make Your Own Edibles?

You can mix hemp flower into baked goods and food products.  It has been done with brownies for many years.  Infusing edibles with hemp is not as simple as measuring a dose and mixing it in.  You must adequately heat your hemp bud in an oven before adding it to the edible you wish to infuse.  The cannabinoids naturally present in a hemp plant exist in an acidic state that our bodies have difficulty absorbing.  Once the bud has been heated (a process called decarboxylation) the CBD-A gets converted into the CBD we are familiar with.

\
So, before you mix your bud into your butter, pre-heat your oven to 260° F.  Next, prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper and evenly spread out your hemp bud.  When your oven is ready, put your flower in the middle rack and keep it in the oven for between one to two hours.  When you pull out your toasted hemp bud, it should be slightly brown, but not burnt.  This is a good sign your hemp is ready to be mixed into your edible products.  For those who want to make CBD edibles but don’t like hemp flower’s taste, you should take a look at Organic CBD Nugs’ odorless CBD isolate powder.

## Could Smokable Hemp Appear On A Drug Test?

Even though our hemp has less than 0.3 percent THC content, that doesn’t mean it can’t appear on a routine drug test.  Everyone’s metabolism is slightly different, so it’s impossible to gauge how your body will absorb smokable hemp flower.

For your safety, please refrain from smoking hemp a few days before you know there will be a drug screening.  If your company has surprise drug screenings, then you might want to reserve smokable hemp for vacations or look into THC-free CBD products like CBD isolate.

### Are There Side Effects To Taking CBD?

Like any other supplement, there’s always a chance you could experience side effects when taking CBD. In most cases, however, the people who experience adverse reactions tend to take higher than average CBD dosages.  A few of the most common side effects related to CBD include: 

•	Headaches


•	Digestive upset


•	Fatigue


•	Nausea

If you experience severe side effects, please stop taking CBD and contact your doctor immediately.

## Is Smokable Hemp Flower Legal?

Smokable hemp is legal at the federal level.  The 2018 Farm Bill legalized the cultivation and sale of hemp products as long as they contain no more than 0.3 percent THC.

While hemp is federally legal, it can still be banned at the state level.  Indeed, many US states still don’t recognize CBD products, regardless of their THC levels.

Some local governments don’t have clear distinctions in place that separate marijuana from hemp.  Both plants can have an identical appearance and similar smell.  There have been cases in which law enforcement mistakenly charge people with possession of marijuana even when they really just have hemp.

## Industrial Hemp vs. Premium Hemp Flower: What is The Difference?

Years prior to the recent CBD boom, cultures around the world viewed hemp primiraly as an industrial crop. There are records as far back as ancient China suggesting farmers utilized hemp to make ropes, clothes, and sails for ships. Today, there is interest in using hemp for everything from biofuel and beauty products to paper and plastic.  Many consumers are under the impression that industrial grade hemp is the same as premium hemp flower.  While both of these crops are technically the same hemp plant, they are processed through different methods.  Generally, industrial hemp farmers plant male and female seeds close together in large fields.  Premium hemp flower is grown using female plants that are spread out to give strains time and space to grow to their full potential.  The focus on premium CBD flower is to produce quality flower vs hemp biomass.  

There are some companies that sell food-grade CBD products that are derived from inferior industrial grade hemp.  Industrial hemp has a weaker cannabinoid profile and often contains harsh chemicals that are not found in organically grown premium CBD flower.

## What is The Best CBD Flower?

If you are new to smokable hemp, picking out a strain from a catalog could present somewhat of challenge.  In order to determine what works for you it is recommended that you look into each strain’s terpene profile.  Terpenes are the aromatic compounds associated with each hemp strain’s distinctive scent and taste.  Figuring out what terpenes are in each strain will give you insight on the flower’s aroma, flavor, and effects.

If you would like more information on terpenes, this article will give you a bit more information.(Terpenes)  For a really quick run down please see below for a brief description of some of the most common terpenes found in CBD Flower.

\
Myrcene: This is a mango like terpene that tends to produce a sedative effect.  Linalool: Found in lavender, linalool generally has a relaxing effect on its users.  Limonene: Citrusy, limonene is associated with energizing its users.  Beta-caryophyllene: Spicy & peppery, this terpene might have anti-inflammatory effects.  Humulene: Also found in hops, humulene typically enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of beta-caryophyllene.  Alpha-pinene: This distinctly woodsy terpene might improve cognition and help with respiratory issues.  Eucalyptol: The defining aroma in eucalyptus trees, eucalyptol might have anti-bacterial and antioxidant properties.
