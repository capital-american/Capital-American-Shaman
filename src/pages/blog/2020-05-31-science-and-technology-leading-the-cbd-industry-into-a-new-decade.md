The CBD industry has been around for a little less than a decade and it’s astounding when you look at how far it has advanced over the last few years.  When CBD first hit the market, the general public knew little to nothing about it.Now, hemp has become so popular that many doctors are starting to recommend it, and major retailers are entertaining the idea of creating their own CBD-infused products.

If it weren’t for the major advancements both scientifically and technologically, the CBD market would not be where it is today. As a result of blending technology and science together, we’ve been able to raise the industry to new heights in every aspect.There is a wider variety of products, better formulations for enhanced bioavailability, a host of clinical studies and much more. Based on how profitable the CBD industry has evolved, these advancements are not expected to decline in the near future.

CBD is predicted to be a multi-billion-dollar industry within just a few years, and with this financial support, new and exciting developments are happening every day. This will allow the CBD industry to continue to improve and find new ways to meet the needs of customers and raise the value of benefits it provides.

As if that weren’t enough, we have a much wider range to choose from when it comes to the hemp itself.  More companies are developing strain-specific formulations, as well as [isolate products ](https://capitalamericanshaman.com/products)that give us potent doses of particular compounds.

Thanks to new advanced testing techniques, Labs have been able to determine more information about hemp than ever. Customers can rely on highly specific information regarding the CBD they purchase.

**5. A Greater Understanding of the Bioavailability of Cannabinoids.**

Bioavailabilty indicates the manner in which CBD and other hemp compounds are absorbed in the body.  In recent years we have been able to research the [bioavailability of hemp](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/proprietary-nanotechnology) compounds with greater detail than ever before.  This has enabled companies to produce products that are even more capable of complete compound absorption.  CBD products that are more bioavailable will provide stronger effects.

**6. A Larger Selection in Potency (Milligram Strengths)**

It is known that different people respond differently to concentrations of CBD, and this has to do with many variables, body weight, personal needs and the specifics of an individual’s endocannabinoid system.  As a result, companies cater products in a wider range of milligram strengths, allowing users to optimize their regimen for their personal goal.

As a result, the industry has responded offering a wide variety of products that can give our furry companions the same compounds we take on a daily basis.  Veterinarians have begun to take note and be onboard with this trend as well.

**9. Research on The Endocannabinoid System**

More scientific studies are being conducted to understand the endocannabinoid system on a more comprehensive level.
