If you are a fan of honey you most likely will love honey infused with CBD.  Get acquainted with CBD honey.  You may be wondering “what’s so great about it”?

Once familiar with CBD honey, the natural course of action would be to make space in your pantry for this delicious, nutritious product.  It has the potential to give your immune system an added boost and also provide a broad spectrum of restorative properties offered by cannabidiol (CBD).  Here are a few facts about CBD honey and what makes it wonderful.

### What Is CBD Honey?

We are all familiar with natural honey and know it’s full of antioxidants.  It gives our body many beneficial enzymes and nutrients and acts as a substitute for refined or artificial sweetners.  As we learn more about the benefits of CBD, it's easy to understand why producers of honey are infusing CBD into their products.

In the unlikely event you haven’t heard of CBD before, know it’s one of the hottest trending products in the health industry.  CBD works to improve the body's balance of our internal regulatory systems.  We have an Endocannabinoid system (ECS) which controls a lot of our basic functions.  The ECS is comprised of receptors throughout the body which are activated by cannabinoids such as THC and CBD. As a result both of these organic compounds have such broad effect on the body and it’s functions.

CBD is not psychoactive, it sooths your body and can potentially provide therapeutic benefits that can range from helping with anxiety, depression, inflammation, arthritis, and more.  This nonpsychoactive cannabinoid is derived from hemp or cannabis.  Because cannabis is still federally illegal, many CBD honey producers across the nation are working with hemp.  Hemp-derived CBD can be combined with many different substances and has no adverse side effects.  Because of its accessibility and potential medicinal properties, it is a wonderful addition to honey.

Honey has long been considered a prime vehicle to deliver herbal medicine because it is one of the most easily digested forms of carbohydrates.  Honey enters directly into the bloodstream, providing effects quickly.  When combined with CBD, honey is the optimal partner to transport the many health-giving benefits that help balance the body.  It’s no coincidence that there has been a surge in honey products.

### Gaining Popularity

CBD honey has gained popularity because of it’s delicious taste, energy-boosting effects, and soothing abilities (particularly with digestion).  After consuming, a warming sensation sweeps over the body within 15 to 20 minutes.

### How is it used?

In addition to adding CBD honey to coffee or tea, you can also eat it with a spoon or combine it with your favorite recipe.  Since CBD is not psychoactive, there is no need to worry about eating too much, but typically one tablespoon is sufficient depending on the brand.  Also, remember that honey is a healthy substitute for sugar.  It’s a natural sweetner that can satisfy a sweet tooth without giving you a sugar hangover.
