## Enjoy CBD Bath Bombs

Did you know that CBD Bath bombs can be a game changer when it comes to bathing?  Wait till you know more about CBD Bath Bombs!

Extracted from the cannabis or hemp plant, CBD or cannabidiol is one of the many naturally occurring plant cannabinoids.  CBD which contains no psychoactive properties, is becoming increasingly popular as a health supplement with a multitude of wholesome benefits.

CBD bath bombs and bath salts are commonly made with CBD oil and other essential oils and fragrances.  Dissolve the bath bombs in your tub, hop in and enjoy your bath time like never before.

## Benefits of CBD Bath Bombs

So how do these bath bombs enhance your bathing experience?  CBD bath bombs are found to stimulate your body in a lot of ways.  With strong anti-inflammatory properties, CBD bath bombs can significantly reduce skin problems, most of which are caused by inflammation.  Soaking in hot water with a CBD-infused product, such as bath salts or a bath bomb, speeds up the process of CBD absorption through skin into the bloodstream.

Absorption via the pores in you skin is one of the most effective ways to ingest CBD.  Compared to oral CBD products that are absorbed much slower through the digestive system, bath bombs help in delivering CBD to your body much faster.  Furthermore, according to a 2014 study, CBD oil has a beneficial effect on sebocytes, which secrete sebum that causes pimples.  CBD bath bombs can help reduce breakouts on your skin.

Research has also discovered the anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of cannabis.  This can help reduce the chances of skin infections. 

CBD is also found to have significant relaxing properties.  After a busy day of tiring work, immersing yourself in a bath with CBD Bath Bombs will help soothe and calm your body and mind.
