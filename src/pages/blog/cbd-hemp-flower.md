## What is Hemp Flower?

Hemp flower is produced by the female cannabis plant when it reaches maturity.  These flowers can contain a wide variety of phytocannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG).  The terpenes and flavonoids in the flower are responsible for the flower’s strong smell, and contribute to the effects produced by CBD and CBG.  For more detailed information on terpenes and how they are a factor look out for our blog on terpenes.

CBD hemp flower has many names.  It is also referred to as Hemp buds and CBD buds as well.

## Buds from Hemp Flower?

Flowering hemp plants produce buds when their flower reaches full bloom.  These buds grow in clusters which are known as cola.  The buds are the part of the hemp plant that contain the highest concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes.  To the naked eye, hemp buds are identical to marijuana. CBD buds can be used in many ways.  CBD is most often smoked but can also be enjoyed by vaping in dry herb-compatible devices, and also in homemade products, such as edibles, creams and oils. 

## What does Smoking Hemp Flower do?

The effects of smoking hemp flower can vary from person to person and also depend on the strain you choose.  Even CBD flower of the same strain can have different levels of potency depending on where it was grown, how it was grown and ultimately how it was harvested.  A strain high in CBD will support feelings of relaxation and mental clarity, while a strain high in CBG tends to support productive focus.  The effects of CBD flower is often described as a soothing, relaxing feeling that can make you more energized or sleepy, sometimes depending on the time of day you consume it.  Smoking hemp flower does not result in getting high because of the low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is found in high concentrations in marijuana.

Smoking CBD flower or vaping it results in nearly instant activation.  The inhale/exhale factor of breathing in the CBD and slowly releasing it, creates a rhythmic relaxation flow that can immediately ease your nerves.  The effects of the flower will activate within a few minutes and should last up to a few hours.

## Does Hemp Flower contain THC?

Hemp flower does contain some THC, but all of our strains are under 0.3% THC by weight, as mandated by the 2018 Farm Bill.  In fact, the minute amount of THC in hemp flower is what defines the difference between CBD flower and its cousin, marijuana.

Does Hemp Flower contain CBD?  Hemp flowers are often high in CBD (cannabidiol) and low in THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  These two molecules are known as phytocannabinoids, or cannabis-like compounds found in plants.  The hemp strains high in CBG, or cannabigerol, typically have less CBD and THC present.  CBG is the “mother cannabinoid” that turns into CBD and THC as the plant reaches maturity.  As growers seek higher levels of CBG in the final product, less THC and CBD phytocannabinoids are present.

## Variances in CBD Flower Strains.

Strains of CBD flower fall into one of three categories.  Indica (night strains), sativa (day strains) and hybrid (mixture of strains).  These are terms to describe different high-CBD strains.  Every strain has its own unique properties and profile but for the sake of generalizaton, you can anticipate the effects listed below.

<b>Indicas:</b> Calming and relaxing are the primary qualities of indica strains.  The soothing terpenes are excellent at relieving pain, and reducing anxiety.  Indica strains may promote a state of sleepiness, so they are often best utilized for evening/night consumption, when you can allow yourself to kick back and relax.

<b>Sativas:</b> Energizing and uplifting is the most popular perk of sativa strains, which are known for having positive mental effects.  Increased mental clarity and concentration, perfect if you find your mind wandering off when trying to complete tasks.  The extra energy is great for getting through a tough day or fighting off fatigue.

<b>Hybrids:</b> Are a blend of Indicas and Sativas.  The effects of Hybrids fall in-between, which is ideal if you want a single CBD flower strain that works for every occasion.  Some Hybrids can calm your anxiety without making you sleepy.  Hybrids can lean to either side so choosing the ideal strain takes some experimentation.
