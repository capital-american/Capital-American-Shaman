For the sake of clarity in this article we must first define "Nano-technology".

## What is "nano-technology"?

In extremely simplified terms, it's taking certain substances, like CBD, and creating nanoparticles of them that are so small, they can be absorbed into the bloodstream more efficiently than regular-sized particles of the same substance.  Research has shown nano-technology to have faster absorption, last longer in the body, and to be more bioavailable than oil.  For instance, from what we know about science and how we absorb oil, it is known that we absorb 12-25 percent of CBD oil when taken sublingually and around 6 percent when ingested.  For this reason, CBD oil is recommended as a sublingual. 

## What makes VG Cloud different than any other CBD oil?

Our nanotechnology breaks the CBD down into smaller particles making it more bio-available thus increasing the absorption rates.  Our cloud tincture bottles come with a dropper and are usually taken orally, under the tongue.  This tincture may also be added to food and to other liquids as well.  When standard CBD oils are added to other liquids they do not mix as oil and water doesn’t mix.  Our Cloud tincture is soluble in water.  The smaller particle size can be ingested and absorbed just as efficiently as it can sublingually.  

In addition to higher absorption we also offer 10 delicious flavors: Blueberry Moon, Cherry Limeade, Cool Berry, Grape, Natural, Strawberry-Banana, Tropical Punch, Apple and Watermelon.  Taste is a factor when working with CBD oils.  CBD oil without flavoring is not by any stretch the tastiest thing to put into your mouth.  In fact, it is less often desired in it’s natural state.  In general, tinctures with vegetable glycerin and flavoring taste better than just straight CBD oil.  With a more pleasant tasting flavored CBD you should be able to keep the tincture under your tongue longer and absorb the CBD oil better.

## What is Vegetable Glycerin?

Glycerin is one of the most common ingredients in the world.  Industry loves this sticky, thick liquid because it is colorless, odorless and sweet.  This is mainly why it is widely used in processed foods, personal care products, and medicines.  In fact, there is almost no industry where you won’t find it. Vegetable glycerin is an excellent emulsifier.  This means that it helps join fats and other liquids together so they don’t separate.  Another important feature is as a solvent, meaning it helps one compound dissolve evenly into another.  This is useful for the preparation of tinctures due to its preservative qualities.  Many companies use glycerine as a stabilizer and an auxiliary solvent in conjunction with water or alcohol.

## What are the options/benefits of Cloud Tincture?

VG Cloud will soon come in an even greater variety of strengths.  It currently comes in sizes, 15 mL with 150 mg of CBD and 30 mL containing 300 mg or 600 mg of CBD.  We will be rolling out additional strengths soon.  We will keep you posted and update this blog accordingly.  Keep in mind that with increased bioavailability this tincture can provide the benefit of oils containing several times the amount CBD in miligrams because your body can make use of a larger percentage of it.  This makes the 600 mg a really strong option.  This tincture is an uncomplicated and convenient way to supplement a healthy lifestyle with CBD (cannabidiol).  Some research shows that full spectrum hemp oil helps relieve many health conditions. Many customers would agree with that belief.
