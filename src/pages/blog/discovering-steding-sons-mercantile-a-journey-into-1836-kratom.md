## **The History of Steding & Sons Mercantile**

Steding & Sons Mercantile is a company steeped in tradition and quality. Founded in the early 19th century in Austin, Texas, the mercantile started as a small family-owned business, focusing on providing high-quality goods to local communities. Over the years, they have expanded their offerings, always maintaining a commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. The introduction of their 1836 Kratom line continues this legacy, blending historical values with modern wellness trends.

## **What is Kratom?**

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. The leaves of the kratom tree have been used for centuries for their medicinal properties.

Traditionally, kratom leaves were chewed or brewed into tea to help alleviate pain, boost energy, and enhance mood.

Nowadays, kratom is processed into various forms, including powders, capsules, and extracts. Its active compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine interact with opioid receptors in the brain, providing pain relief, relaxation, and euphoria at higher doses, and stimulating effects at lower doses.
