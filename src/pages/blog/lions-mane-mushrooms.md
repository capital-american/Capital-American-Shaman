## Benefits of Lion's Mane

While this mushroom is under research and scientists are unveiling its exciting features, there are not enough factual claims. However, until now, studies have revealed the following potential health benefits of Lion's mane. 

**Brain Function** 

Some studies have suggested that Lion's Mane mushroom may have neuroprotective properties and may be able to improve brain function. Since lion's mane mushrooms contain Hericenones, they promote brain cell development and shield them from Alzheimer's disease-related damage.

Moreover, a rodent study showed that lion's mane mushroom and its extracts could minimize neuronal damage. They also provided neuronal protection from amyloid-beta plaques that scale up during Alzheimer's disease. 

**Relieve depression and anxiety**

Do you know that more than one-third of the population of America and other developed countries exhibit signs of anxiety and melancholy? You might not know that chronic inflammation can significantly contribute to depression.
According to rodent studies, lion's mane mushroom extract has anti-inflammatory properties that help mice with their anxiety and depression symptoms. Moreover, another research proposed that lion's mane extract assists brain cell regeneration and the working of the hippocampus (emotion and memory processing part of the brain).

The decreases in anxious and depressive behaviors observed in mice given these extracts are thought to result from better hippocampus functioning, according to researchers. Since Lion's mane interacts with the hippocampus, it can reduce depression symptoms.

**Digestive Health**

Lion's Mane mushroom can also lend a great hand for beneficial digestive health since it prevents ulcers. A contributing factor for stomach or digestive tract ulcers are H. pylori overgrowth. Several earlier studies discovered that lion's mane extract could stop the development of H. pylori in a test tube. However, no research has examined whether the extract has the same effects when taken internally. Moreover, this fungus can also help with bowel ailments such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease due to its anti-inflammatory properties. 

It's crucial to remember that the botanical product employed in these trials contained a variety of mushrooms, making it challenging to conclude the effects of lion's mane in particular.

Overall, the study indicates that lion's mane extract may help prevent the growth of ulcers, but additional human research is required.

**Could potentially Reduce Risk of Heart Disease**

Obesity, elevated triglycerides, a lot of oxidized cholesterol, and a higher propensity for blood clots are all significant risk factors for heart disease.
According to research, lion's mane extract can impact some of these variables and lower the chance of heart disease.

Lion's mane mushroom extract has been shown in studies on rodents and mice to enhance fat metabolism and reduce triglyceride levels.

According to a 2010 research study, taking lion's mane extract daily for 28 days reduced weight gain by 42% and triglyceride levels by 27% which in turn minimize the risk of heart disease.

Additionally, lion's mane fungi have a hericenone B substance that can reduce the blood clotting potential, leading to heart attacks.

**How to Use Lion's Mane**

When consuming this mushroom, you can take it as a supplement or as a cooking ingredient. Since it has a mild flavor, it can blend well with a wide range of foods. Moreover, you can use its tinctures and drops to add to your favorite drinks. 
However, if you use it as a whole, its meaty texture makes it the best vegan meat substitute. You can chop it up and add it to stir-fries, tacos, burgers, and more for a delicious and satisfying plant-based meal.

You can also consume them as a dietary supplement in the shape of capsules or powder. In fact, you can also add it to coffee or tea as a supplement.
Mixing hot water with powdered or whole mushrooms can turn it into tea.

**How to Properly Dose Lion's Mane**

It is best to read the label before using a dietary supplement, mainly if multiple ingredients exist. Follow the directions on the label thoroughly, as the dosages for supplements vary from 300 mg to 3,000 mg, taken one to three times daily.

Start with a lower dosage of a lion's mane supplement if you are unsure how your body will respond, then gradually increase it.
The intake of lion's mane mushroom extract or supplements should be discontinued immediately if you experience any allergy-related symptoms, such as itching or digestive problems.

**Does Lion's Mane Have Side Effects?**

Despite the fact that lion's mane is typically well-tolerated, the most frequent adverse effects are gastrointestinal distress, nausea, and skin rashes.

Before trying lion's mane, speak to your doctor if you have a medical problem, a history of allergies, asthma, or other health issues.

If you have any adverse reactions, stop taking lion's mane until you have spoken with a medical professional. According to a 2022 study, symptoms of a potentially severe allergic response to lion's mane mushrooms are itching, swelling, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.

**Conclusion**

Lion's mane is an excellent option for those seeking a healthy diet supplement. You can use lion's mane in different forms, but the best one is a tincture, as you can conveniently add it to tea or food with measured doses.
