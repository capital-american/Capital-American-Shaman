## About Turkey Tail

Turkey tail is a type of mushroom widely distributed worldwide, including in North America, Asia, and Europe. As said earlier, its scientific name is Trametes versicolor, and it is also known by other common names such as "cloud mushroom" and "yun zhi" in Chinese.

The name "turkey tail" comes from its colorful fan-shaped fruiting bodies, which resemble the feathers of a turkey's tail. The cap surface of the mushroom is velvety and multicolored, with concentric bands of varying shades of brown, gray, and cream. The underside of the cap is white or yellowish and has numerous tiny pores that release spores.

Turkey tail grows on dead or dying trees and other woody substrates, and it is a saprobic fungus, meaning that it feeds on dead or decaying organic matter. It is a very common and abundant mushroom, and it can be found in a wide range of habitats, from forests and woodlands to urban parks and gardens.

Turkey tail has been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems, particularly in China and Japan, where it is called "yun zhi" and "kawaratake," respectively. It is also used in Native American healing practices. In recent years, turkey tail has gained attention as a potential medicinal mushroom and has been studied for its potential health benefits.

## Benefits of Turkey Tail

Turkey tail is a medicinal mushroom used for centuries in traditional medicine systems, particularly in China and Japan. It contains various bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and sterols, which are believed to be responsible for their therapeutic effects. Some of the health benefits of turkey tail mushrooms are:

#### Anti-Cancer Properties

One of turkey tail's most well-known potential health benefits is its role in cancer treatment and prevention. [Studies](https://doi.org/10.2174/187221312798889310) have shown that the polysaccharides found in turkey tail have anti-tumor properties and can boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer. In fact, turkey tail extract has been approved as a complementary [treatment for cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/mushrooms-pdq) in Japan and China.

#### Enhances immunity

Polysaccharide-K and polysaccharide peptides (PSP), two polysaccharides with [immune-stimulating qualities](https://doi.org/10.3390/v14020426), are highly concentrated in turkey tail. Immunomodulators like PSK and PSP boost and stabilize the immune system to back the body's defense against infection, cancer, and other disorders.

[PSPs](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2681-7) promote the development of immune cells to aid in the defense and protection against infection. According to [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.11.009), PSPs may encourage the development of monocytes that boosts immunity and fights infections.

Similarly, PSK supports the immune system by causing the body's immune system's killer cells to become active in the battle against illness and infection. Additionally, it has been [demonstrated](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-011-0075-7) to control the body's immune response by reducing inflammation, which may offer protection against inflammatory diseases.

#### Improve Gut Health

Turkey tail has also been studied for its potential role in improving gut health, as it contains prebiotic fibers that can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

According to [studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01087/full), using turkey tail as a treatment can benefit the bacteria in the gut in a manner comparable to using prebiotic supplements.

In a [test-tube study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23435630/), for instance, it was discovered that turkey tail extract altered the composition of the microbes in the gut by elevating populations of helpful bacteria like Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus while lowering populations of potentially dangerous bacteria like Clostridium and Staphylococcus.

Improved intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, a stronger immune system, lower cholesterol levels, a lower chance of developing certain malignancies, and better digestion have all been related to having a [healthy amount](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5031164/) of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria.
