### How CBD Products can help your pet.

Did you know that CBD or Cannabidiol can have an array of positive health impacts on animals?  CBD is well known for its potent anti-inflammatory and potential healing properties.  It can help with a wide range of animal-specific ailments when given to your pet.

Whether your pet is experiencing anxiety or chronic pain, CBD is often found to provide them quick relief.  As with any condition, severity is always a factor.  CBD Products are easy to administer for animals and can help you manage their health regimen well. 

Hemp CBD products at Capital CBD contain less than 0.3% THC, which is the compound that has psychoactive properties.  This near zero concentration of THC implies that CBD products will not get your pets high and are safe for consumption. 

At Capital CBD you can shop a variety of CBD products for pets in a safe and welcoming environment.  

### What are the Benefits of CBD for Pets?

CBD products are found to relieve stress and anxiety among animals.  Whether it be separation anxiety or stress due to loud noise and disruptions, CBD oil can help calm your pets and give them relief. 

With anti-inflammatory properties, CBD can help ease pain in pets.  Management of arthritis, nerve related pain and other inflammations can potentially be helped by CBD products. 

Epilepsy affects about 5% of dogs and 2% of cats, and the medications used to treat it can be dangerous to your pet's digestive and cardiovascular systems, even though they are successful at reducing seizures.  CBD is found to have a positive impact in reducing epilepsy and seizures among pets and offers you a more holistic approach at treatment. 

Certain studies have shown that CBD products work well in pets to help treat skin conditions like excessive hair loss, patches, red skin and rashes.  It may also help in healing wounds faster due to its anti-inflammatory properties.  Dealing with nausea and appetite loss in pets can also become easier with CBD products. 

### What to look for in CBD Products for Pets

While CBD products are available in a variety of forms, CBD oil is perhaps one of the most efficient ways to administer cannabidiol to your pets.  Unlike other edibles, the dosage of CBD can be adjusted and measured more accurately when in the form of oil or tinctures.  When it comes to convenience treats get the nod. 

The CBD products that you buy have to be sourced from organic hemp plants grown in the US, with no artificial ingredients.  It is important to ensure that the products are third party tested for safety. Third party lab tests can certify whether the CBD products you buy are organic and free from pesticides, harmful chemicals, microbes and heavy solvents. 

The American Kennel Club stresses the importance of choosing organic products, not skimping on price, ensuring access to the product's lab review, and opting for liquid CBD tinctures.

Always read the labels of products that you wish to buy.  Full spectrum CBD products are considered to be the best CBD products available because they preserve all available plant cannabinoids.  Products should be organic, allergen and gluten free, GMP compliant and should be manufactured using highly specialised extraction processes.
