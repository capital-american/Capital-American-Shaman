•	**Soothes muscles and relieves tension.**

CBD massage oils and creams are great for people suffering from muscle tension. Massaging the affected part of the body helps relieve tension. This works by increasing muscle temperature and improving muscle elasticity. Coupled with the soothing action that CBD provides, CBD massage oils make for a potent remedy.

•	**Reduces anxiety and paranoia.**

Massaging is known to have psychological effects on the body. It provides a feeling of comfort and rest after being administered. CBD has been shown to reduce anxiety and paranoia by its interaction with the CB1 receptor in the endocannabinoid system (ECS) found all over the body. This makes it a great addition to massage oils and creams. You can buy CBD massage oils online for a more wholesome mental experience.

## **How to use CBD massage oil.**

Always start with reading the label recommendations before using CBD massage oil. Apply your preferred amount of oil on the affected area and gently begin to massage the area. Use the heel of your hand to apply the oil a little more firmly. 

This will improve circulation to the area and warm your muscles. Then you can begin to focus on the problem areas, firmly massaging into them to maximum effect. Using a muscle roller can help you get the best of the process. You can also buy CBD massage oil with higher amounts of CBD for a more potent remedy.
