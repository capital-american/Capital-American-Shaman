# Live Rosin—Everything you Need to Know! 

Due to recent trends toward legalizing cannabis, a wide range of cannabis products is now offered, with various consumption methods. Although smoking cannabis flower is still the most common way to consume cannabinoids, more users are dabbing, smoking, and vaping high-potency concentrates for a unique and different experience.

One specific concentrate, live rosin, is becoming increasingly well-liked among cannabis aficionados.  Understand the fundamentals of live rosin, including how this cannabis product is extracted and how to use it in this article. So let's get to it!

## What is Live Rosin?

Live rosin, which differs from other preparations like shatter and wax, is a robust and orangey material. It is a solventless concentrate, which means that the chemical solvents used in the extraction process for other hemp extracts are not used in this one. Many hemp users who care about their safety find the absence of chemical solvents appealing.

Cannabis plants that have just been frozen are used to make live rosin. A rosin press extracts rosin from frozen plants by applying pressure and temperature. When dried hemp plant matter is employed, rosin results; the "live" in live rosin denotes frozen plants' source material.

"Live" rosin offers a more distinctive experience because it has more terpenes than other cannabis rosin products. The extraction procedure is what distinguishes live rosin from cured or flower rosin.

### Live Rosin Manufacturing Process

Due to its lengthy manufacturing process, live rosin is costly and challenging to find. Eliminating hemp plant leaves that are not clearly trichome-rich is the initial stage in the procedure. The plant buds are then placed into plastic baggies and vacuum-sealed before being placed in the freezer.
To maintain their ingredients and moisture more effectively, live rosin freezes the hemp flowers when they are still young instead of drying and curing them after harvesting.

Manufacturing bubble hash, the fresh-frozen concentrate made from frozen cannabis flowers, is the third stage of the production process. The final step is to crush and heat-process this concentrate to create live rosin extract.

### Live rosin vs. live resin.

It's crucial to understand the differences between live resin and rosin before moving on. Although the two words sound nearly identical, there are some key distinctions.

One key difference between both is that live resin (not rosin) is, in reality, butane hash oil. Since it uses the solvent base Butane in its preparation, you can not consider it solvent-free. Now you might ask why we regard it as "live?" Because it's created from fresh bud or trim, it's regarded as "live."

As with the live rosin before processing, the plant material is frozen immediately after harvest to prepare live resin.

And since the terpenes and cannabinoids are prevented from degrading by freezing the resin, live resin is renowned for having rich flavors. But unlike live rosin, the live resin can occasionally leave a chemical aftertaste due to the solvents.

Conversely, live rosin is produced entirely without the use of solvents. It is "cleaner" and chemical-free because pressure and heat are used in production. Given that live rosin is manufactured from flash-frozen flowers, it is pure and has all the terpenes intact without any unpleasant chemical flavors. Because you are not breathing in harmful chemicals, it is even better for your health. 

### How Do You Consume Live Rosin?

Because people believe it to be the least hazardous, most users prefer live rosin. Unlike other hash and hemp waxes, it is less toxic to the lungs due to its lack of solvents.

You only breathe solvents from unadulterated plant extracts when you smoke live rosin. Some people choose to vaporize live rosin using a top-notch dabbing setup.

For several reasons, using a dab rig is better than smoke. You can avoid breathing in the toxins produced by smoking using a dab device. Additionally, inhaling vapor can be more accessible and healthier because it may be less unpleasant to the nose and lungs.

Other applications for live rosin include Twaxing, a method of mixing live rosin with hemp buds(dried) before smoking it in a bong or a pipe.

### Why Live Rosin?

**Potency**

Live rosin's potency at a cannabinoid level usually remains between 75–85%, and its terpene content of 4–15%, which is unparalleled to any other cannabis product. So, refined cannabinoids such as THC and CBD account for more than three-quarters of the composition of live rosin, with the terpenes that give it its flavor and aroma making up the majority of the remaining components. There is nothing but the best in it, in fact.

**Healthy Alternative**

Additionally, due to its purity, live rosin is the most excellent choice for your health. There will usually be traces of butane or other chemicals in other preparations. You consume possibly harmful compounds if you consume or smoke those other preparations. These dangers are eliminated when using rosin because no solvents are ever utilized.

**Other Benefits**

Live rosin also offers the following advantages: 

·         It's ideal for dabs since it has a lower melting point.

·         Makers typically make it by hand because they value quality.

·         Due to it being solvent-free, it is preferable for those who use cannabis for medical purposes because it won't worsen their diseases.

·         The extract resembles the cannabis plant the closest in flavor and effectiveness.
