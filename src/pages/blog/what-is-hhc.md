# A closer look at HHC

HHC seems to be the new cannabinoid on the block.  HHC stands for [hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexahydrocannabinol). It is a hydrogenated derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol.  There are several isomers of this form of THC.  In simple terms, HHC is to THC, what margarine is to butter.  Margarine uses the slogan “I can’t believe it’s not butter” so you could probable imagine  what slogan HHC could adapt.  This all occurs by saturating the molecule with hydrogen atoms, the shelf-life of this cannabinoid is extended substantially without affecting the effect profile very much. HHC is a naturally occurring cannabinoid but in only minute amounts which can be found in the pollen and seeds of hemp. In order for companies to produce HHC products, they have to produce substantial amounts of it in a lab.

The molecules of HHC are much more robust that THC, hence its stability in storage and when exposed to heat or UV light.  Delta 9 THC  is the strongest natural-occurring form of THC, but it is also the least stable. As it oxidizes, it loses hydrogen atoms and forms two new double bonds on its top ring structure. After that THC becomes CBN — which has only 10% of the psychoactivity of THC.

## What Are The Effects of HHC?

HHC can produce effects that are very similar to the effect produced by THC. It may produce feelings of euphoria and stimulation, altered visual and auditory perception, changes in heart rate and body temperature, and cognitive function.  Effects can vary  greatly from person to person but if you are look for a general consensus please see below.

While less potent that THC milligram for milligram, HHC uses ofter report an experience somewhere between the effects of Delta-8 THC and Delt-9 THC.  In short it is more cerebral than delta-8 but less than THC. Also there can be a huge difference product to product as well so so even comparing the same form and strength product can vary greatly from company to company.  HHC is more potent than delta 8.

HHC products is new so there are few studies available that evaluate its effects.  It appears that this cannabinoid is similar in structure and effect of other forms of THC.  Some studies on animals have shown that HHC does possess notable painkilling effects on rats.

With HHC, the double bonds of the molecule have been broken and replaced with hydrogen (Hydrogenation).
