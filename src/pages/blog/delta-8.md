# Delta 8 THC in Texas?

You may have heard about Delta 8 THC and wondered what exactly is it?  Delta 8 Tetrahydrocannabinol goes by many names, D8 being one of its popular references. Delta 8 is a minor cannabinoid that naturally occurs in cannabis plants at very small concentrations. It is not directly produced by cannabinoid synthesizing enzymes within the plant.  When THC is stored for a period of time it can degrade into delta 8 THC.  Selective breeding and molecular isolation can be utilized to access greater quantities of delta 8 THC.  Delta 8 is distinct from the THC that is often mentioned in conversation when referring to THC which is usually a reference to delta 9 THC.  In comparison, delta 8 THC is an analogue of the delta 9 THC molecule with a similar structure but some notable differences. While both substances share similar properties such as reducing nausea, stimulating the appetite and soothing pain, delta 8 tends to exhibit a lower psychotropic potency than delta 9 THC. Δ8THC can alter and elevate your mood, it is much more functional than Δ9THC and far less intoxicating. It can provide “buzz” without the levels of paranoia, intoxication or anxieties delta-9 THC is known to provide.

Delta 8 was not widely available outside of the medical marijuana industry until after the [2018 Farm Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2) allowed for cannabinoids like Δ8THC to be legalized at the federal level.  This has given CBD and THC companies all around the world a green light to produce delta 8 Vapes, Gummies, Tinctures and delta 8 Flower that demonstrates these properties.  Just in case you were wondering, Delta-8 THC is a federally legal substance available for sale in the United States.

### How Delta-8 works?

 Delta-8-THC binds to the CB1 receptor like delta-9-THC, but its attraction to the receptor is different due to its altered molecular structure. The CB1 receptor is responsible for mediating most of the psychotropic effects of THC. This difference in binding may be responsible for the reported clearer high with reduced anxiety and greater ability to concentrate that’s often associated with delta-8-THC. It is likely that the molecular structure also impacts the chemical’s effects on other receptors and neural pathways.

### Entourage Effect

 The entourage or ensemble effect is the principle that THC molecules work better when taken in conjunction with other cannabinoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and compounds present in cannabis, rather than as an isolated molecule. While the knowledge and research we have about the entourage effect is primarily based on delta-9-THC, the molecular similarity of delta-8 could mean that it produces enhanced effects when ingested as whole-plant extract rather than as an isolate.

More research is needed to gain detailed insights into the ensemble effects of delta-8 and whether its presence helps to mediate the effects of other cannabinoids.

### How does Δ8THC compare to Δ9THC

While both cannabinoids produce psychoactive effects, users generally experience a more uplifting and active feeling with Δ8THC.  It typically does not produce the anxiety and paranoia that is common with Δ9THC usage. Δ8THC tends to yield a more manageable “heady” feeling typically allowing for more activity while in use, compared to Δ9THC which tends to be felt more in the body and can often limit the desire for physical activity.

If you are using cannabinoids and still need to make things happen Δ8THC may be the better option. If you’re looking to become one with your couch Δ9THC might give you more assistance in accomplishing goal.

### Side Effects and Warnings

 As a cannabinoid there is still a lot that is unknown about delta-8-THC, which warrants a some caution in using it. Delta 8 is generally available in concentrate forms, because most cannabis flower contains less than 1% delta-8-THC. To acquire a significant amount of this cannabinoid, a great amount of extraction and refinement has to occur.  While some delta-8-THC concentrates are isolates, other products can combine delta-8-THC with CBD for a full-spectrum type effect.  If you are on the fence in regards to consuming delta-8-THC, please be aware that a much of the current knowledge we have about the cannabinoid is based on animal studies. Research on animals has indicated that delta-8-THC (along with delta-9-THC) resulted in increased blood pressure by temporarily constricting the blood vessels. The rise in blood pressure was then followed by a drop in blood pressure and a slower heart rate. That being said, the effects observed in animals can be very different from the effects observed in humans.  The authors of the review concluded that there is limited data about the effects of delta-8-THC, and further studies need to be conducted in human populations to understand how it induces changes in blood flow.

Note, the FDA strongly advises that during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, you avoid using CBD, THC, or marijuana in any form.
