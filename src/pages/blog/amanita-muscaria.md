# Amanita Muscaria 

Do you remember your childhood stories and fairytales where you saw red mushrooms with white dots on top?  We all adored them in childhood, but there is more to that mushroom than just memories.  The Amanita Muscaria mushroom is one of the most familiar fungi.  

Its bright red cap with white spots makes it easily identifiable.  Moreover, the fly agaric is profoundly and peculiarly psychedelic and unmatched by any other psychoactive material. 


Are you interested in learning more about this mushroom?  Read this guide till the end!

### Physical characteristics of Amanita Muscaria 

Apart from folklore and fairytales, you must identify the Amanita Muscaria with its physical properties. Why?  Because despite being easily identifiable and a beautiful mushroom, it is also potentially toxic, and you should not consume it without proper identification and preparation. 

Speaking of its physical appearance, you will see a red or scarlet mushroom cap stemming from the white base.  It is usually 5-20 cm in height and 1-2 cm in diameter. 


Another thing that sets this mushroom apart is its cup-shaped structure, known as the volva at the stem base.  Next, its gills are white and tightly spread from the stem's edge to the cap's center shaggy rings of scales, and it has a sizable skirt.  Note that the gills do not tightly fit the stem and may turn yellow or brown with aging mushrooms. 


Keep in mind that the blusher (Amanita rubescens) has a similar shape, a pale, reddish-brown crown, and cream spots, so you should not mistake it for this mushroom.

### Chemical composition of Amanita Muscaria 

The two star ingredients of this mushroom are Ibotenic acid and muscimol.  While the mushroom's cap, stem, and gills contain them in varying amounts, the cap is usually a headquarter of them.

Note that both these chemicals have poor reputations due to their psychoactive properties.  Regarding that, Ibotenic acid is broken down by the body's cells into muscimol which leads to altered awareness, euphoria, and hallucinations, among other things. 


Apart from these two substances, Amanita muscaria also houses several amino acids, proteins, and sugars.  Besides, it also contains some toxic ingredients like muscarine and agaritine.  So if you consume them in large amounts, you might encounter symptoms like sweating, salivation, and stomach pain.

### What to Expect When Taking this Mushroom? 

Although many individuals consider it hallucinogenic, it isn't hallucinogenic in reality.  Instead, it alters the perception, unlike any other hallucinogen.  You can say that this mushroom is lucid since you will see things slanted.  

But note that the effects of Amanita muscaria differ from person to person since the dose, physiology of the individual, and preparation technique all come into factor.


You must take high doses for this mushroom to be genuinely hallucinogenic.  Moreover, it will awaken hallucinations and may have many unpleasant, possibly harmful side effects.


Some users report that it presents a dreamlike state.  After taking fly agaric, most people fall asleep within a few hours, at which point the actual effects of this mushroom become apparent, lulling you into an odd dream world. 


We don't advise anyone taking this mushroom for its psychedelic effects due to its unexpected character and the high risk of side effects.


Most people who use this mushroom regularly take small amounts of micro doses to encourage brighter dreams which is what it’s famous for. 


This mushroom produces difficult-to-understand dreams that are hardly regarded as "visionary" due to how disorganized and unpredictable they are.


### The Side Effects of Amanita Muscaria


There is a bad reputation of Amanita muscaria being extremely poisonous.  Most mushroom identification lists classify this species as having toxic properties.


But, according to the North American Mycological Association, there hasn't been a documented death from this mushroom in more than a century, even though several compounds found in the mushroom flesh are neurotoxic.


Having said that, there have been reports of toxic side effects, notably in those taking extremely high doses or those who already have liver or kidney disease.


The following are a few of the frequent adverse effects of Amanita muscaria:

●	Nausea and diarrhea 

●	Feeling lightheaded and confused 

●	Blurred vision, sweating, and skin burning


●	Loss of motor control and synchronization


●	Increased blood pressure and pulse rate


●	Disorientation and confusion


●	Anxiety and agitation


●	Heavy breathing


●	Seizures (rare)


Consuming Amanita muscaria can also be risky because it occasionally produces severe toxicity.  The quantity consumed and the person's susceptibility to the mushroom's compounds can affect how harmful and adverse the reactions are.  As a result, it's critical that you take care and abstain from eating this mushroom unless instructed to do so by a qualified expert.

### Dosage of Amanita Muscaria Mushrooms 

The recommended psychoactive dosage of the chemical compounds of fly agaric is approximately 6 mg for muscimol and 40 mg for ibotenic acid.  It equals about three medium caps or about 1.5 large caps. However, the amount of each of these substances in the mushroom varies considerably. 

The proportion of the active ingredients in the mushroom can be affected by several variables, including the amount of rainfall, ambient temperatures, host tree type, elevation, and season.  Without conducting laboratory tests, it is impossible to determine the dosage of these mushrooms.


However, the following is a rough dosage guide for Amanita muscaria mushrooms:

1. Microdose: less than 1 gram of dried mushroom powder
2. Threshold Dose: 2-3 grams of dried mushroom powder
3. Standard Psychoactive Dose: 5-10 grams of dried mushroom powder
4. High Dosage: 10-30 grams of dried mushroom powder 

   Never take more than 10 grams of this mushroom at a time because the adverse effects get worse with increased dosage. 

   ### Conclusion


   Amanita muscaria can help you have more vivid dreams and lucid effects.  You can use this mushroom in different forms, but the tincture is a good option since it is easier and more accurate to dose.  Remember, since this mushroom entails psychedelic effects, always start with a tiny amount while consuming it.
