# What is water soluble CBD Oil?

<br><br>

Water soluble CBD is CBD oil that has been broken down to a smaller particle size.  This process is described as “nanotechnology”. These tiny particles are easier for the body to absorb, allowing the benefits of CBD to take effect faster.  This process also allows it to mix easily with mix with water or food. Water soluble CBD is great for cooking or adding to drinks as opposed to regular CBD oil which can separate if mixed with water-based consumables.

## Benefits of water soluble CBD?

American Shaman makes water soluble CBD using nanotechnology, which makes the CBD particles smaller for easier absorption and better bioavailability. This smaller particle size allows the oil to dissolve in water and to enter the body quicker, allowing the effects of CBD to occur much quicker than non-water soluble CBD. Our water soluble CBD uses our proprietary process to bring you the highest quality nano CBD oil for the best price.

CBD is known for its broad range of health-supporting effects, including stress relief, occasional anxiety, relief from discomfort, relaxation, and much more.  Our focus centers on bringing the benefits of CBD to you.

Water soluble CBD also allows more options for intake.  It gives full control over the measurements and is compatible with more consumption preferences. Water soluble oil can increase consumer convenience as the CBD can easily be added to any drink without needing prior knowledge on how to best use the product.

## CBD vs THC? What is the difference?

CBD and THC are both major cannabinoids that are derived from the same plant, Cannabis Sativa.  These cannabinoids can be found in varying amounts depending on the strain of cannabis. Hemp strains contain a higher amount of CBD and a low amount of THC. In fact, hemp plants must contain only 0.3% THC to remain legal. Marijuana strains are opposite in they contain a higher amount of THC when compared to CBD.

CBD is known for its wide variety of health-supporting effects, while THC is known more for the psychoactive effects users experience. Unlike THC, CBD does not produce psychoactive effects, and will not get it’s user high. Our products comply with nationwide legal standards and are third-party tested to ensure they contain less than 0.3% THC.

## How is Water Soluble CBD oil different from ‘regular’ CBD oil?

CBD comes in different products in numerous forms. ‘Regular/standard’ CBD oil is typically taken as a tincture, placed and held under the tongue. When viewed under a microscope, this CBD oil is actually made up of globules (or ‘globs’) of oil, in which the CBD molecules are locked up.

Your body has to process CBD in order to use it.  This means your digestive system must break up the oil to unlock the CBD found inside. For your body to use water soluble CBD, there is no additional work. It is already broken down so your body does not have to.  To make your CBD water soluble, the CBD must go through a proprietary nanotechnology process, which breaks apart those tiny globs of oil for you before it is bottled. Because the oil has been broken apart, water soluble CBD has taken on a new ‘form’ of sorts and can be added to any liquid and consumed and will work much faster.  Think seconds vs minutes.

An easy way to compare the two is to drop them into water; ‘regular’ CBD oil floats on the surface, while Water Soluble CBD oil disperses like die dropped into water. Once die is cast in creates cloud pattern which also describes what happens when you drink Water Soluble CBD oil. Rather than having to go through digestion, the oil disperses through your body immediately.

## What is Nano CBD?

“Nano” is a scientific term describing a measurement that equals ‘one billionth.’ After shattering apart hemp oil using proprietary nanotechnology, each particle of oil measures about 55-85 nanometers, or billionths of a meter! Nano CBD refers to the CBD molecules which are encapsulated in these tiny globs of hemp oil.

To be precise, the actual measurements of the CBD inside the oil do not change; a CBD molecule is the size of a CBD molecule, period. The globs of hemp oil that contain the CBD are broken up into smaller particles, enabling the CBD to rapidly work its way through your body.

## How long does water soluble CBD take to work vs Regular CBD?

Regular CBD is locked up in hemp oil so the body must first digest the oil before utilizing the CBD inside. This process results in the commonly reported 30-minute to 90-minute wait for the effects of CBD to start.

The digestive process can be destructive to the CBD, allowing only a small portion of the CBD consumed to actually be used by the body. Because our proprietary nanotechnology process shrinks the particle size of the hemp oil globs containing CBD, the effects of water soluble CBD can be felt in just moments. The smaller particle size of water soluble CBD avoids the digestive process completely.  It is more or less absorbed rather than digested.  Just about all of the water soluble CBD consumed is available for the body to use immediately. These factors combined yield a much more powerful effect from water soluble, or nano, CBD compared to ‘regular’ CBD.

## How does Water Soluble CBD make you feel?

Water soluble CBD does not cause a psychoactive effect.  There is no ‘high’ involved, as with ‘regular’ CBD, nano CBD helps you return to a feeling of balance. The only difference is how efficient water soluble CBD is providing effects. 

When using standard CBD products, there’s often a 30-minute wait (or longer) for the effects of CBD to set in. The body needs to time break down the hemp oil containing the CBD. Because water soluble nano CBD oil has already been broken apart through proprietary nanotechnology, the use gets to skip that step and go directly to enjoying the effects of CBD.

Water soluble CBD can potentially ease the everyday stress, we all encounter.  I could possibly lift some of the weight off your shoulders in a matter of moments.   Relaxation is often the result of the body reaching its natural state of homeostasis, or balance.  Water soluble CBD should feel like a rapid return to a more "balanced" feeling.

## Full Spectrum Hemp Oil?

There are many cannabinoids found in CBD oil derived from hemp that work to balance your body. Trace amounts of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), CBC (cannabichromene), CBG (cannabigerol), THCV (tetrahydrocannabivarin), CBDV (cannabidivarin), CBDA (cannabidiolic acid), THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), CBGA (cannabigerolic acid), and many more cannabinoids, all work together to create the ‘Entourage Effect’ and produce the beneficial effects of hemp oil. There are 113+ know cannabinoids all together.  When these cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids are found together in hemp oil, it is called Full Spectrum Hemp Oil. Full Spectrum is also referred to as a whole plant extract.

The Endocannabinoid System, or ECS, works to create balance between cellular communication in your body. The ECS utilizes endocannabinoids inside the body to signal and control many our bodies basic functions, including appetite, mood, energy level, pain and more. The cannabinoids in hemp are so similar to the endocannabinoids naturally produced by your body that they are able to bond to the same cellular receptors.  This is why CBD can be beneficial to the body and mind.

## How does water Soluble CBD taste?

Our proprietary nanotechnology process increases effectiveness and CBD in hemp oil and in doing so it also increases the intensity of the flavor of hemp. The taste becomes more earthy and definitely more bold.  To offset the taste we offer flavored variants of our Water Soluble products.  You can enjoy Cherry Limeade, Grape, Pina Colada, and Lemon. If you prefer unflavored nano CBD oil we carry it as well.  The tastes tends to be more prevalent in water but many feel nearly disappears in tea.

## How much Water Soluble CBD should I take?

The amount of nano or water soluble CBD the body needs for balance varies greatly from person to person. Due to the reduced particle size of the hemp oil that contains CBD that has been broken down, less nano CBD is needed to produce the same effects as ‘standard CBD tincture.

An easy way to understand the equivalent serving size is to divide your typical intake of ‘regular’ CBD by 10. If you normally use 50 mg of CBD, that’s about equal to 5 mg of water soluble nano CBD. Another important point to note is that by taking nano CBD regularly, there’s a cumulative effect as CBD builds up in the body. For this reason, we advise our customers to start “slow and low” when beginning to use water soluble nano CBD. Once you start taking our water soluble cbd it’s easy to note how efficient it is.

We recommend starting with two daily servings of a half dropperful of our Water Soluble 300, delivering 5 mg of fast-acting nano CBD per serving. After a week, if you still feel out of balance, move up to a full dropperful at each serving. As a ceiling, we recommend not taking more than 60 mg (six whole dropperfuls of Water Soluble 300) of nano CBD per day—unless under the supervision of a physician.

## How long will my bottle of Nano Water Soluble CBD last?

Each 30 mL bottle of Water Soluble Nano CBD contains 60 servings of ½ dropperful each. Following the labeled 2 servings per day, a single bottle should last you for a month. If you only need the support of Water Soluble CBD occasionally, a bottle will last you longer.
