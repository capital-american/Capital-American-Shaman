## What is CBD Oil?  

CBD oil is made by extracting cannabidiol from hemp plants with varying degrees of other cannabinoids and plant compounds. 

CBD stands for cannabidiol which is the compound in hemp plants that have a multitude of health benefits. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), on the other hand, is the compound that makes people "high." Phyto-Cannabinoids, Bioflavonoids, and Terpenes are also abundant in the hemp plant.
CBD Oil is manufactured after with only trace levels of THC at most, which means that the oil will not get you high. CBD therefore does not have any psychoactive properties. Rather it offers you a host of benefits that can help your body remain fit and healthy.

### How does CBD oil work?

Cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors, which are part of the endocannabinoid system, to produce positive effects in the body.  Many of our basic functions are controlled by the endocannabinoid system.

The human body creates two types of receptors- CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors. 
CB1 receptors can be found all over the body, but particularly in the brain. Movement, pain, emotion, mood, appetite, memories, and other functions are all coordinated by them.

In the immune system, CB2 receptors are more important. They have an effect on inflammation and pain.
While THC attaches itself to CB1 receptors, causing you to be ‘high’, CBD stimulates body receptors in such a way that the body generates its own cannabinoids called endocannabinoids. These are found to have several health benefits on the human body. 

### What are the benefits of CBD Hemp Oil?  

CBD Oil is proven to have several benefits pertaining to health and wellness. Some of them include: 

1. **Pain Relief and anti-inflammatory properties:**  

   The natural pain relief properties of CBD Oil are being vastly explored. CBD injections are found to have decreased pain response to surgical incision in a rat study, while oral CBD treatment substantially reduced sciatic nerve pain and inflammation in another rat study. A combination of CBD and THC has been shown to be beneficial in reducing pain associated with multiple sclerosis and arthritis in many human studies.
2. **Anxiety, stress and depression:**  

   Several studies on humans have provided results that indicate that CBD Oil has a positive effect on relieving anxiety and stress. A study published in the Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry in 2019 shows that among 57 men, those who were given 300 mg of CBD oil exhibited less anxiety than those who were given a placebo. 
3. **CBD May Support A Healthy Cardiovascular System:** 

   According to a 2017 study published in JCI Insight, CBD oil can potentially lower the risk of heart disease by reducing hypertension (high blood pressure) in some people. The results indicate that CBD oil may be an effective complementary treatment for people with hypertension that is exacerbated by stress and anxiety.
4. **May have neuroprotective properties:**  CBD's ability to function on the endocannabinoid system and other brain signalling mechanisms, according to researchers, may help people with neurological disorders.


   Treating neurological disorders including epilepsy and multiple sclerosis is one of the most researched uses for CBD. CBD Hemp Oil is also found to have positive neurological effects on some people suffering from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s.
