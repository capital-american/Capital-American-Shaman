# What Are CBD Topicals?


Before we dive into the benefits of CBD topicals, let's first define what they are. CBD topicals are skincare products that are infused with CBD. They come in various forms such as lotions, creams, balms, and oils, and are applied directly to the skin. Unlike other CBD products, such as oils or edibles, topicals are not ingested and are meant to be used externally.

## How Do CBD Topicals Work?

When applied to the skin, CBD topicals interact with the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is responsible for regulating various bodily functions, including skin health. CBD binds to receptors in the ECS, which can help regulate inflammation, pain, and other skin issues.

### The Benefits of Using CBD Topicals

#### Could Relieves Pain and Inflammation

One of the most well-known benefits of CBD is its ability to relieve pain and inflammation. When applied topically, CBD can target specific areas of the body and provide localized relief. This makes CBD topicals a popular choice for those suffering from conditions such as arthritis, muscle soreness, and chronic pain. 

#### Improving Skin Health

CBD is rich in antioxidants, which can help protect the skin from free radicals and environmental stressors. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, making it beneficial for those with skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis. CBD topicals can help reduce redness, irritation, and promote overall skin health.

#### Hydrates and Nourishes the Skin

Many CBD topicals also contain other beneficial ingredients such as essential oils, vitamins, and moisturizers. These ingredients work together with CBD to provide deep hydration and nourishment to the skin. This can help improve the appearance of dry, dull skin and leave it looking radiant and healthy. CBD skincare can make a dramatic difference to the overall condition of your skin.

#### Reduces Signs of Aging

As we age, our skin naturally loses elasticity and begins to show signs of aging such as wrinkles and fine lines. CBD topicals can help combat these signs of aging by promoting collagen production and reducing inflammation. This can result in smoother, more youthful-looking skin.

#### Easy to Use and Non-Psychoactive

Unlike other CBD products, such as oils or edibles, topicals are not ingested and do not enter the bloodstream. This means that they are non-psychoactive and will not produce a "high" feeling. Additionally, CBD topicals are easy to use and can be incorporated into your skincare routine without any extra effort.

### How to Choose the Right CBD Topical

With the growing popularity of CBD, there are now countless CBD topicals on the market. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the right one for you:

#### Source of CBD

It's important to choose a CBD topical that is made from high-quality, organic hemp. This ensures that the CBD is free from harmful chemicals and pesticides.

#### Potency

The potency of CBD topicals can vary greatly. It's important to choose a product with a potency that is suitable for your needs. If you are new to CBD, start with a lower potency and gradually increase as needed.

#### Additional Ingredients

As mentioned earlier, many CBD topicals contain other beneficial ingredients. Consider what other ingredients are included and how they may benefit your skin.

#### Third-Party Testing

To ensure the quality and potency of a CBD topical, look for products that have been third-party tested. This means that an independent lab has verified the contents of the product and can provide a certificate of analysis.

#### How to Use CBD Topicals

Using CBD topicals is simple and can easily be incorporated into your skincare routine. Here are some tips for using CBD topicals:

#### Cleanse Your Skin

Before applying a CBD topical, make sure to cleanse your skin to remove any dirt or impurities. This will ensure that the CBD can penetrate the skin and provide maximum benefits.

#### Apply to Targeted Areas

CBD topicals are meant to be applied directly to the skin, so make sure to target the areas where you want to see results. This could be areas of pain or inflammation, or areas where you want to improve the appearance of your skin.

#### Massage Gently

To help the CBD absorb into the skin, gently massage the topical into the skin using circular motions. This will also help improve blood flow and promote relaxation.


**Use Daily**

For best results, use your CBD topical daily as part of your skincare routine. Consistency is key when it comes to seeing the benefits of CBD.
