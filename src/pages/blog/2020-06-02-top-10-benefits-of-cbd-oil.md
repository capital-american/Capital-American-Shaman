Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural compound derived from cannabis plants. CBD is one of over 100 cannabinoid compounds that can be found in these plants. Hemp-derived CBD oils do not contain more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the physcoactive, intoxicating cannabinoid found in marijuana.  THC creates a high effect.

Hemp has been around and used for thousands of years as a therapeutic treatment.  New research has continued to reveal even more benefits that cannabis products have to offer.  CBD is used as a wellness product to promote well being and overall wellness.

**You may be wondering, "What Does CBD Do"?**

Before diving into the benefits of [CBD oil](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/cbd-oils), it is important to have an understanding of exactly how CBD works with the human body.  CBD works with our body’s natural endocannabinoid system (ECS) to help regulate a range of some of our basic functions.  This regulation of functions keeps the body in a state of homeostasis. The ECS is a signaling system in the body which uses endocannabinoids to interact with cannabinoid receptors throughout the body.Our body’s naturally produce endocannabinoids but the amount produce is not always an optimal amount.  When CBD interacts with the ECS, the CBD can help facilitate the process of endocannabinoids binding with the receptors to improve the chemical communication between the receptors and cells the receptors are regulating. CBD has been known to mimic endocannabinoids and stimulate the ECS to help regulate various functions of our body.

Here are some of the top benefits of CBD oil:

**1. Helps Ease and Can Erase Minor Discomfort**

The ECS helps to regulate the nervous system, which is the system that controls nerve function, muscle repair and formation, joint function and other vital organs. [In a 2018 Research Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.01259/full), researchers revealed that CBD has the ability to ease discomfort by impacting the activity between a number of factors in the ECS. Since the receptors in the ECS lead to a cellular reaction in the nervous system to activate regulation, CBD can help stimulate the endocannabinoids and regulate the nervous system. The overall efficiency of the endocannabinoid can be increased by CBD. This can lead to better results, thus relieving mild discomfort throughout the body.

**2. Supports Joint Health**

Joint health is incredibly important in staying active and mobile as you grow older.[A study from 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28885454) found that CBD can support joint function by protecting the joint nerves and supporting healthier cartilage.  When CB2 receptors located in the ECS interact with CBD, it has the ability to block harmful cells from causing joint damage. CBD lowers the production of [collagen antibodies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.01259/full), which have been known to accelerate the decrease of your joint cartilage function. Collagen is made up of amino acids.These amino acids can help synthesize collagen in your body.  When collagen is digested, it’s broken down into amino acids.Your body takes this broken down collagen and delivers it wherever the need is greatest (think tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, etc).  When CBD interacts with the receptors responsible for regulating joint function, it can help stimulate better results and better overall joint health.

**3. Provides Positive Mental Support**

CBD can help you cope with everyday stresses, provide positive mental support, and help improve your mood. [Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-012-2878-7) has shown that CBD may change the way the brain receptors respond to serotonin.  Serotonin is the chemical associated with emotional health and happiness.  Brain receptors are proteins that transmit chemical communication to other cells in the brain to invoke a response and stimuli.  When the brain encounters CBD, it affects the receptors in the brain to respond to serotonin in a more efficient way, which may result in a calming effect.  By improving the way the brain responds to serotonin, it can help support overall mental wellbeing.

**4. Support of Cardiovascular Health**

When it comes to heart health, it’s important to make sure you are taking the right steps to ensure your cholesterol and blood pressure fall within a healthy zone.  In a[ study published in 2017](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/93760), some of the participants saw a decrease in blood pressure after using CBD oil. This means that CBD may help some people support their cardiovascular function in order to keep them healthy and feeling great.  CBD’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties may be able to reduce risk factors that can lead to heart disease, like high blood pressure.  It may also be able to reduce the risk of related conditions, like strokes.

**5. Improves Rest**

CBD may make some people [drowsy](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476), which could be useful in promoting restful sleep.  If CBD does make you sleepy, using it before bed could help you get to sleep faster.  Since CBD also helps relieve everyday stresses, it may help a person relax at the end of a long day so they can get better sleep at night.  CBD affects different people in different ways.  For some, it could induce a sense of calmness and drowsiness, while in others it may increase their energy levels and help them stay awake, alert, and focused.

**6. Boosts Energy**

Since the endocannabinoid system helps regulate many of our basic bodily functions, CBD can help give the ECS an extra boost to help regulate these functions. That boost from CBD may translate into an [increase in energy](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/blog/why-grab-that-second-cup-of-coffee-when-you-can-take-cbd-oil) because the body is returning to a state of homeostasis.  CBD can increase energy levels a by strengthening body cells that are responsible for making you feel sleepy and sluggish.  The energy that one feels after taking CBD may feel similar to the same boost one may feel from caffeine only without the jitters or inability to fall asleep.

**7. Neuroprotective Properties**

[Researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938896/) have discovered that CBD has the ability to generate neurological benefits by reducing damage to the brain and nervous system.  When CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system, it can help brain function through promoting the development and growth of new neurons.  This can be achieved by facilitating and stimulating endocannabinoid receptor activity which helps regulate brain functions.  CBDcan also help to reignite your focus and mental clarity, allowing you to think a lot clearer soon after taking it.

**8. Supports Immune System Health**

The endocannabinoid system helps to regulate immune system response.  CBD has been shown to help support and strengthen immune system health by improving ECS functions and fighting harmful chemicals. [ Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/) shows that cannabinoids, including CBD, can decrease the release of cytokines in the body.  Cytokines are the chemicals our bodies releases when under stress. This chemical weakens the immune system lowering the bodies ability to protect itself.  CBD helps support the immune system by decreasing cytokine production and improving the functions of the ECS.

**9. Promotes Clearer Skin**

[One study](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/64628) conducted with human subjects discovered that CBD has the ability to decrease oil activity in the sebaceous glands.  Sebaceous glands produce sebum, the substance that hydrates the skin with natural oils.  Once the production of sebum is reduced, the skin doesn’t create an overly oily environment for breakouts to occur.  CBD produces this effect in some users, not all CBD users will experience this benefit.  However, individuals with skin blemishes caused by oily skin could definitely experience improvement.  Numerous studies have shown that CBD oil has anti-inflammatory benefits when applied to skin. This makes CBD a suitable ingredient for acne-prone skin, while its calming benefits help reactive skin look and feel better.

**10. Promotes Overall Health**

The main function of the endocannabinoid system is to maintain a state of homeostasis for the body.  In short, homeostasis is the balance and stability of the body’s internal processes that may change with external conditions. These conditions include body temperature and other crucial processes.  CBD can play an integral part in helping the ECS function properly to maintain homeostasis and regulate various bodily processes.  As a result, CBD enhances the efficiency of the body’s existing endocannabinoids interacting with the cannabinoid receptors that regulate various functions.  CBD can also mimic endocannabinoids and stimulate the ECS to create the same results that endocannabinoids invoke.  CBD can be beneficial to your overall health and wellness by interacting with your body’s natural endocannabinoid system.

**CBD Benefits in Summary**

CBD has a broad range of health benefits from supporting joint function and helping inflammation, to promoting positive mental health.  CBD affects everyone differently so there is no guarantee that any specific benefits will occur in any particular person.  If you experience any [adverse side effects](https://cbdamericanshaman.com/blog/can-someone-be-allergic-to-cbd), it’s advised that you discontinue using CBD.  For the most part, CBD is safe and works with the body’s natural systems to promote a state of homeostasis and overall well-being.
