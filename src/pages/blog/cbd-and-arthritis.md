# CBD for natural pain relief – What you need to Know

CBD or cannabidiol is a cannabinoid extracted from the cannabis plant.  CBD products are made with zero to trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which means they don't get you high.

Available in a multitude of forms, CBD is found to have a plethora of health benefits.  Relieving chronic pain caused by arthritis is perhaps one of the most recognised among them all. 

## So can CBD help ease the pain associated with Arthritis?

Among the most common causes of disability in the US, arthritis is a condition where the joints face inflammation, causing pain and stiffness.  There are different types of arthritis, the most prevalent being rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

CBD is found to provide therapeutic aid for pain for those with arthritis.  A[ 2019 survey by the Arthritis Foundation](<https://www.arthritis.org/about-us/news-and-updates/cbd >) indicates that people with arthritis are very much considering CBD as a complementary therapy.  Industry reports also indicate that individuals suffering from arthritis are among the top buyers of CBD oil.

While research is still in its preliminary stage, certain studies on humans and animals have proven that CBD may be of great use in relieving pain from arthritis.

CBD was found to be a viable treatment option for joint pain associated with osteoarthritis in a [2017 rat study](https://innocanpharma.com/cbd-for-arthritis-the-latest-research/).  A 2011 study concluded that CBD impacts the way pain receptors respond to stimuli, thus reducing inflammation and pain caused by arthritis.

CBD interacts with receptors in the body, altering their response, thus reducing pain and inflammation.  CBD oil interacts with two of the pain receptors in our bodies – CB1 and CB2 receptors.  These are responsible for pain and effects of inflammation.

CBD has anti-inflammatory effects too, which could help with the inflammation in the joints of those suffering with arthritis.

CBD has also been found to play a role in our immune systems.  When we know that RA is an immune system problem which attacks our joints, it’s easy to see why CBD could work well for the symptoms of RA.
