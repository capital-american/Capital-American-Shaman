## CBD is often used to help fight chronic pain

Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant.  CBD is extracted and infused into products with little to no tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the substance that produces the high in marijuana.  Research has shown that CBD offers a multitude of health benefits.  Chronic pain relief is one of the most recognised positive impacts of CBD on the human body.

## How does CBD help deal with Chronic Pain?

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) states that there is evidence which indicates that cannabis or CBD may have moderate benefits for chronic pain.  CBD oil is found to help relieve chronic pain by reducing inflammation.  CBD oil also encourages better sleep and, as a result, treats sleep disturbance, which is normal in people with chronic pain.

CBD reduces pain signals in your body by influencing neurotransmitters and adenosine levels.  Intake of CBD is shown to increase adenosine levels, thus curtailing the sensation of pain.  By playing the role of an antioxidant, CBD reduces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.  CBD also helps reduce anxiety, stress and sleep disruptions that are normally associated with chronic pain. 


## CBD for Neuropathic Pain 

Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the somatosensory system.  Diseases like multiple sclerosis, injuries like herniated discs, and infections like shingles all cause this form of pain.  In 2018, a study published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at the use of a number of cannabis based drugs and found that they could help with chronic neuropathic pain.

## CBD for Arthritis Pain

Several studies have concluded that CBD may be helpful in dealing with pain caused by arthritis. According to a 2019 study by the Arthritis Foundation, people with arthritis are actively using CBD as a supportive therapy.

CBD was found to be a viable treatment option for joint pain associated with osteoarthritis in a 2017 rat study.  CBD alters the way pain receptors react to stimuli, reducing inflammation and pain associated with arthritis, according to a 2011 report.
