# Delta-8 Flower

The duration of delta-8 flower effects is largely determined by the dosage and method of administration. The effects from delta-8 THC can last anywhere from 3 to 8 hours, if not longer.  This length, however, might differ depending on whether you smoked delta-8 THC or consumed it as an edible.

Currently, you may select from a variety of delta-8 THC infused hemp strains, such as our delectable delta-8 Bubba Kush or Pineapple Express pre-rolled joints.  If you want to vape, you may try our selection of delta-8 THC vape cartridges if you prefer terpene-rich concentrates.

The effects of inhaling a few puffs of delta-8 THC concentrate or a joint of bud enriched with delta-8 can last anywhere from 2 to 5 hours, depending on how much you smoke.  Delta-8 THC edibles, on the other hand, have a longer duration of action.  It normally takes 30 minutes to two hours for them to take action after you consume them, depending on how long it takes your body to digest and process them.  Delta-8 THC edible effects might last anywhere from 5 to 12 hours.  It varies greatly form person to person.

# Delta-8 Tincture Legality

Delta-8 THC is a legal derivative if it is derived from hemp.  Naturally occurring hemp products are legal under federal law, according to the 2018 Farm Bill.

Due to the scarcity of delta-8 THC in nature, extracting delta-8 from raw hemp material is costly and time consuming.  Fortunately, manufacturers have found an alternative way to produce the compound; cannabinoid conversion.  All cannabinoids evolve from CBGA (cannabigerolic acid); CBGA is often referred to as “the mother of cannabinoids”.  Over time, CBGA naturally converts into a specific cannabinoid such as CBD or CBG.  In nature, this process is affected by the environment, plant genetics, and more, which is why some cannabinoids are more prominent than others.

In a lab setting, manufacturers can control these variables and manipulate CBGA’s conversion process, producing their desired compound.  Unbeknownst to most, this already happens with many of today’s more niche compounds, such as CBG.  These products are synthetic.  Of course, some people may only want naturally-derived compounds.  But because delta-8 occurs in such small quantities, it’s not profitable for companies to obtain it in this way.  As both CBD and delta-9 are so prevalent in cannabis, it’s typical for manufacturers to use these two compounds in the conversion process.  So, how is delta-8 THC really made?

CBD is transformed to delta-8 THC using a chemical catalyst.  As a result, the DEA classifies the resultant delta-8 THC as "synthetically generated" and hence a Schedule I narcotic rather than lawful.

Furthermore, because of their similar chemical structures, not all drug tests can distinguish between delta-9 and delta-8 THC.  As a result, even if you haven't used delta-9 THC, delta-8 THC can trigger a drug test failure.  Nonetheless, each state has its own position on the usage, distribution, and sale of CBD American Hemp Oil.  

# How to Buy Delta-8 

Nearly every CBD store has now joined the delta-8 THC craze, delivering products to satisfy all cannabis enthusiasts.  However, it's critical to buy from reputable manufacturers that have credentials proving their product is safe and contains the proper quantities of delta-8 & 9 THC.

Capital American Shaman is the place to go if you don't want to waste time looking for a reputable brand.
