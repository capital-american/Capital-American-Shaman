## What is a CBD Vape Cartridge?

CBD vape cartridges are pre-measured, sealed containers that connect to a battery.  The carts allow you to vape CBD safely without burning the oil and producing smoke.  The CCELL carts are available in 500mg and 1000mg.

Each vape cartridge contains a full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, or isolate CBD formula.  The carts never have additives commonly found in e-juices.  Many companies offer natural flavoring to improve the vaping experience.

Not all added ingredients are harmful.  Many consumers prefer natural flavors to enhance their vaping experience.  Consider options with all organic fruit flavorings, such as strawberry, lemon, orange, and berry.

Some brands, such as Honey Oil CBD and Secret Nature CBD, sell a simple CBD vape pen with their cartridges.  These options are excellent for new users to try vaping for the first time.

## What are the Different Formulas?

Each blend offers something different for everyone.  A full-spectrum CBD vape oil contains all 545 known compounds found in the hemp plant.  This formula includes more than 100 known cannabinoids with similar characteristics to CBD.

It also has approximately 140 terpenes, flavonoids, minerals, and essential oils.  It also contains a small amount of THC.  The hemp plant legally has up to 0.3% THC, which is safe and won’t produce the high associated with cannabis.  However, some drug screenings can pick up the small amount of THC and cause issues relating to interactions with the federal government and specific state employers that don’t permit products with THC.

A broad-spectrum extract removes the THC.  Some consumers are uncomfortable with the compound but still want the remaining 544 naturally occurring plant extracts.  With this blend, the buyer gets the best of both worlds, a near-full-spectrum of potent phytochemical without THC.

An isolate precisely how it sounds.  It’s 99.9% pure CBD.  These formulas go through a second round of extraction to eliminate all other compounds during the extraction process.

## Reasons to Use CBD Vape Oil

Vaping is a quick and easy way to use CBD oil.  Many people enjoy smoking hemp flower, but any smoke is dangerous, even if it’s not nicotine.  Vaping gives the option of experiencing the full 545 hemp compounds without injuring your lungs with smoke.

This method of using CBD is more discreet than smoking hemp and, in many cases, easier than using a hemp oil extract.  While a CBD tincture is always a great option, it’s easier to take a few puffs of your vape when you’re in social situations, driving, or other events that produce stress and anxiety.

Most consumers use CBD vape oil to relieve stress and anxiety.  Additionally, many buyers enjoy the relaxing euphoria it produces to calm down and sleep better at night.  The hemp extract is an all natural way to unwind and get a better nights rest.  Some people use CBD to reduce normal inflammation associated with the natural aging process or following a rigorous workout.

## Is it Safe to Use a CBD Vape Pen?

According to the U.S. Government it is.  After the U.S. Government legalized CBD products in late 2018, there were some problems with vaping products.  Following much research by many major institutes, it was determined the issues weren’t related to vaping.

Instead, it found two troubling situations.  Some brands added a vitamin E oil to thin out products and reduce the amount of CBD in each cartridge.  Another issue involved the cartridges.  Consumers were purchasing black market items made with inferior metals.  Once heated, they began to breakdown into the oil, making the user sick.

Vaping CBD is safe when you purchase high-quality products from trusted brands that don’t contain unsafe ingredients or inferior cartridges.  Choose a brand that provides a certificate of analysis that provides a full account of the components.

An independent lab checks each batch for potency, purity, and safety.  The COA verifies the third-party facility tested for contaminants.  Common purity problems include solvents from using unsafe extraction methods.  It can also show heavy metals from hemp grown in poor quality or contaminated soil.

For the best results, only choose vape products that use a solvent-less removal process.  You also want hemp grown in nutrient rich, U.S. soil.

## Side Effects of Vaping CBD Oil

Like anything you put in your body, there are adverse reactions for some people using a CBD vape pen. All side effects are mild, and you can reduce them with a lower dose.  The most common include irritability, nausea, and excessive sleepiness.  Of course, for consumers using the hemp extract to improve their sleep, it’s the intended effect.

## How to Vape CBD Oil

It’s simple to vape CBD oil.  It comes in a sealed cartridge that screws into a CBD vape pen.  The device has a separate charger that requires you to disconnect the cartridge to charge.  The effects of vaping CBD oil are nearly instant.  So, it’s best to start with a single puff or two and wait a few minutes to see how it affects you.  You can continue to take additional puffs.  There are no records of people overdosing or having long term or severe effects from the all natural plant extract.

The effects won’t last longer than 60 minutes.  If you’re using CBD for options other than falling asleep quicker or anxious feelings and stress, consider using an edible or capsule first.  These offer a longer duration of four to six hours, and the vape provides relief while you wait for the oil to begin working.

Many consumers prefer using their vape pen for convenience.  CBD vape oil is a safe, effective, and easy way to use the popular hemp extract for any situation.  You can choose a CBD cart with or without an accompanying pen from our top-selling brands, Secret Nature and Honey Oil.
