## How is THCa Flower Produced? 

THCa flower is made by hydroponic growers who use a special enzyme in the nutrients to prevent the conversion of THCa into THC.  These growers use popular strains of cannabis and make sure that the end product remains within the legal limit of Industrial Hemp, which is less than 0.3% THC by dry weight.
 

## How does THCa Work?


Although THCa does not have the psychoactive effects of THC in its raw form, it still has therapeutic benefits.  THCa is an acidic form of THC and is believed to have many benefits on its own.  However, to unlock the psychoactive effects of THCa, it needs to go through a process called decarboxylation, which is a fancy word for heating up or lighting on fire.  When you heat THCa, it converts into THC, which is what gives you the traditional marijuana high.  This is why THCa flower needs to be heated before consumption to activate its psychoactive effects.

## Is THCa Legal? 

THCa is legal due to the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized industrial hemp and products derived from it.  As long as the THCa flower contains less than 0.3% THC by dry weight, it is considered legal under federal law.


## What type of effects does THCa flower give you?


THCa flower can provide the same effects as typical THC and marijuana, but only after it has been heated and decarboxylated. Until then, the THCa flower will not produce psychoactive effects but may still have therapeutic benefits.


## How do I use THCa Flower?


THCa flower is used by heating it to decarboxylate the THCa into THC.  This can be achieved by heating it with fire or in an oven at around 200-250°F for 30-40 minutes.
