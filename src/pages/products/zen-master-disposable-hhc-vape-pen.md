This is the same smooth experience as our original cartridge but with a battery pre-charged. This rig is ready to perform right out the box.  This disposable pen is branded white with Zen Master printed branding on the pen. This vape is filled with 1 mL of pure HHC (Hexahydrocannabinol) that will knock your socks off when you try this formulation. It is a gram cartridge and will give a lasting experience for this unique psychoactive experience.

As with the original cartridges the strain available tend to have the following effects:

**Lifter:** Potent sativa-dominant strain with uplifting effects. Perfect strain for daytime users who want a clear mind and\
a deep body relaxation for everyday stress.
