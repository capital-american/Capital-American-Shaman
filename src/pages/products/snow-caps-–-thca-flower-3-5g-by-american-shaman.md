# **About American Shaman THCa Snow Caps**

Experience the pinnacle of potency with American Shaman’s newest flower option, THCa Snow Caps!

This Indica Dominant Hybrid flower is dusted in 99% Pure THCa Isolate offering an unparalleled euphoric experience.

#### **What is THCa?**

Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa) is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp and cannabis. However, when heated, it undergoes a process called decarboxylation and converts to the psychoactive compound THC.

#### **What is THCa Isolate?**

THCa Isolate powder is cultivated from premium THCa Flower. Once harvested, the flower goes through an extraction process that produces high-purity and high-percentage isolate powder. The powder is then used to coat the THCa flower, giving it a lightly dusted, frosty appearance and significantly intensified effects.

These Snow Caps are sealed in nitrogen-flushed containers to preserve freshness and potency. Nitrogen packaging prevents spoilage by removing oxygen and protecting the product from light, air, and moisture.

*Indica Dominant Hybrid | 46.59% THCa | 3.5mg*
