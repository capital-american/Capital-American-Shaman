While this product does not show that it contains Delta 9 THC but it should not be used if you need to pass a drug test for work or any other reason.

There is supposed to be air pocket at the top of the tank. When the cartridge is made, the oil is poured to the top of the tank and capped quickly to prevent leaking. Over time the oil gradually soaks into the coil area creating space at the top of the tank. This can be as much as 40% of the total amount, which can make tanks appear partially unfilled while  containing a full amount of product.
