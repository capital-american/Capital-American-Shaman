Zen Master's HHC Flower will be the new favorite for sativa lovers. This flower can provide a bit of focus, energy and euphoric effects that tend to had around.  In many ways it can even compete with Delta 9 flower experiences.

**Jack Herer**

Jack Herer is a well-known sativa strain that gives users feelings that all is good.  n creative and focused. This strain is sometimes classified as a sativa hybrid but we would say this one is leaning more on the sativa side with HHC.

**Durban Poison** 

Strain Durban poison is a perfect sativa strain that comes out of a South African port city named Durban. This strain is top-rated for energizing effects and leans toward a creative mindset.

**Green Crack** 

Green Crack tends to be energizing and and creates a dynamic duo with HHC. It is also referred to as "Green Crush" and "Mango Crack." If you're feeling spent or need a pick me up, Green Crack might help you power up.

**Strawberry Cough**

Strawberry cough is a well sought-after sativa strain that users fall in love with its fruity flavor. While we can't promise you'll get a joint full of fruit, it's uplifting, cerebral and will create an energetic experience to get you going.
