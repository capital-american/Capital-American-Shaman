## What is HHC?

HHC is an acronym for Hexahydrocannabinol. It is one of around 113 cannabinoids and shares some similarites with Delta 8 THC. While it is found naturally within the hemp plant, it is found in only trace amounts. This means it needs to be made in a lab by skilled chemists for a sizable amount to place in products or to test scientifically. However, HHC doesnâ€™t contain THC. Therefore, at no point in the process does the product go over 0.3 percent Delta 9 THC. There is no conflict between HHC and the [Farm Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2/text).
