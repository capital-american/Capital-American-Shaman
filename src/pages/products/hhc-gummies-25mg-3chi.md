# About 3CHI HHC Gummies:

How Do You Dose An HHC Gummy?

Before taking any amount of HHC, it is important to figure out how to dose the appropriate amount. Keep in mind that HHC gummies are more potent than delta 8 gummies. Dosing out HHC is often described as following similar rules to THC. For new and first-time users, it is typically recommended to begin with half a gummy to start. Remember, it is always possible to take more later. The last thing you want is to be feeling overwhelmed during what should be an extremely pleasant experience, and for that reason, it is important to carefully measure out your dose prior to consumption. To start, take half a gummy or less and wait at least 2 hours to see how your body reacts before considering taking more.
