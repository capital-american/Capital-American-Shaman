# **About Barney's Botanicals Delta 9 THC Syrup**

Barney's Botanicals Delta-9 syrups are high-quality hemp-infused drink additives that offer a convenient and versatile way to consume THC. These syrups are crafted using premium ingredients and are carefully infused with nano-sized delta-9 THC, a psychoactive compound found in hemp known for its euphoric effects.

With nanotechnology, delta-9 THC becomes water-soluble. It enhances the human body’s absorption capacity and as a result, our bodies absorb 5 times more THC than with traditional delta-9 THC oil.

These syrups are easily incorporated into lots of things including cocktails, mocktails, snow cones and sauces, or you can even just take a sip from the bottle. The versatility of these syrups makes them a popular choice among hemp enthusiasts who appreciate the opportunity to experiment and get creative with their hemp consumption.

**Try all four delicious flavors:**

***Blueberry Cheesecake***

***Blue Razz***

***Pineapple***

***Tropical Punch***

Each bottle contains 420mg of D-9 THC with a suggested serving size of 1 Tsp (28mg D-9 THC).

All of Barney’s Botanicals products use hemp sourced from the USA and utilize third-party testing to ensure every product is up to the standards you deserve.
