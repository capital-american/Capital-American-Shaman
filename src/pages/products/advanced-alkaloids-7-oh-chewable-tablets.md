# **About 7-OH Advanced Alkaloids - Chewable Tablets**

Unlock the power of 7-OH Advanced Alkaloids: The Next Generation of Health and Wellness!

#### **What is Kratom?**

Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is a cousin to the coffee plant, indigenous to Southeast Asia. It is often used as a stimulant and for discomfort relief. Traditionally, the leaves have been brewed as a tea, and more recently, they have been dried and then crushed or powdered.

Mitragynine, a primary, active alkaloid in kratom, is recognized for its potential to enhance mood and reduce discomfort by interacting with the brain’s opioid receptors.

#### **What is an Alkaloid?**

Alkaloids are naturally occurring plant compounds, known for their potent biological effects. They have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and are the basis of many modern pharmaceuticals.

#### **What is 7-OH?**

7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) and Mitragynine are considered the two primary psychoactive alkaloids in kratom and are responsible for its opioid-like effects.

7-OH is known for its powerful intensity, far more so than Mitragynine. Its strong nature means that less is needed for the same experiential effects. The formulations are designed to minimize negative side effects by using only the most effective parts of the kratom plant.

7-OH outshines Mitragynine with its more dynamic and vibrant profile creating a positive aura and promoting feelings of balance and joy.
