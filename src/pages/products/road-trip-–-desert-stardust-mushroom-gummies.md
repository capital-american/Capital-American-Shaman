# **About “Desert Stardust Gummies”**

Buckle up and hold on tight for the adventure you’re about to take with Road Trip’s - Desert Stardust Mushroom Gummies! These aren’t your average gummies, they’re a ticket to a unique and colorful journey of the mind.

Desert Stardust is well-known for its mind-expanding effects. These gummies frequently induce euphoric and introspective feelings, fostering a deeper sense of connectedness with one’s surroundings and inner self. Additional effects include altered perception, vivid visuals, changes in thought patterns, profound happiness, laughter, and joy.

#### **Are these legal and do they contain Psilocybin?**

This product does not contain Psilocybin. These gummies utilize a proprietary blend of legal tryptamines, nootropics, and adaptogens to mimic Psilocybin’s effects.

In an effort to create a unique product, Road Trip does not disclose the specific composition of the tryptamines used in their formula.

### **Directions**

**Starting Dose:1/2 Gummy -** This initial dose is sub-perceptual, meaning you won't encounter strong psychedelic effects. Instead, you may notice subtle mood changes, increased creativity, and focus. It's an excellent choice for enhancing clarity and uplifting your mood gently without the intensity of a full trip.

**Low Dose: 1- 2 Gummies -** Expect heightened senses, increased creativity, gentle body high, giddiness, and a subtle shift in consciousness, offering a taste of psychedelia without being overwhelming.

**Moderate: 3 - 4 Gummies -** Indulge in delightful sensory experiences and profound joy with heightened visuals, deeper introspection, and an enriched connection with your surroundings.

**High Dose: 5 - 6 Gummies -** Prepare for an immersive psychedelic journey with an intense exploration of altered perception. Brace yourself for vivid visuals, a profound interconnectedness, and a deep dive into your thoughts and emotions. It's an experience that promises to transport you to new realms of consciousness.

**Buckle Up: 7 - 8 Gummies -** Brace yourself for an inner awakening experience. Anticipate intense visuals, altered perceptions of time and reality, and profound introspection. This dosage is tailored for seasoned users seeking a transformative journey into the depths of consciousness.

Each pack contains 8 gummies (4g of equivalent effects to dried caps) with four flavor options: *Blue Raspberry, Strawberry, Green Apple, and Pineapple*

***Attention: If you are currently using serotonin-regulating medications such as SSRIs, antidepressants, or similar drugs, please be aware that these gummies may not produce the desired effects. Individuals on such medications have reported feeling little to nothing from these products. Serotonin-regulating medications, like SSRIs, are designed to balance serotonin levels in the body and stabilize mood. Introducing external forms of serotonin, such as through our gummies, may disrupt this balance and increase the risk of interactions, including serotonin syndrome. This warning applies to all similar medications designed to stabilize mood, including MAOIs, SNRIs, and TCAs.***
