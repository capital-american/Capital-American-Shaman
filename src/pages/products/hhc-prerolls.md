**Brand: Zen Master**

Not all Joints are created equal.  Our Zen Master HHC Joints are derived from premium, American-grown hemp and infused with high-amounts of HHC (hexahydrocannabinol) to help you get the uplifting sensation you deserve. HHC can be liken to Sativa in the effects presents.

This easy-to-use HHC Pre Rolled joint is ready to go.  All you have to do is pop the top.

Lab results illustrate the purity and potency of this product, which also includes trace amounts of CBD to help regulate Homeostasis (balance) in the body thanks to the Entourage Effect.

If you are looking pass a drug test then this is probably not the product to look towards, but if you are looking for a natural psychoactive experience it's definitely a product to look into.

HHC is legal in all US States which also makes it a great alternative to Delta 8!

**Strain availability for HHC pre rolls:**

**Durban Poison Strain**\
Durban poison is a perfect sativa strain that comes out of a South African port city named Durban. This strain is top-rated for energizing effects and leans toward a creative mindset.\
\
**Jack Herer Strain**\
Jack Herer is a well-known sativa strain that gives users feelings that are blissful, creative and focused. This strain is sometimes classified as a sativa hybrid but we would say this one is leaning more on the sativa side with HHC.

**Strawberry Cough Strain**\
Strawberry cough is a well sought-after sativa strain that users look to because of its fruity flavor. While we can't promise you'll get a joint full of fruit, it's uplifting, cerebral and will create an energetic experience to get you going.\
\
**Green Crack Strain**\
Green Crack often described as energizing and it pairs very well with HHC. It is also referred to as "Green Crush" and "Mango Crack." If you're feeling  worn out or tired, Green Crack might add some pep to your step.

**SUGGESTED USE**\
No more than 1/3rd of pre-roll every 12 hours.
