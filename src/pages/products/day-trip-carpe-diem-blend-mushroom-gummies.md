# **Road Trip - MICRODOSED Gummies + Functional Mushrooms**

Enhance your mood and sharpen your focus with Day Trip’s - Microdose Mushroom Gummies!

Designed to help you “Seize The Day” and embrace each moment with clarity, focus, and a touch of natural magic, these gummies are crafted with a 50mg blend of Lion’s Mane, Cordyceps, and Reishi functional mushrooms and just a sprinkle of the Desert Stardust psychedelic formula.

#### **Are these legal and do they contain Psilocybin?**

This product does not contain Psilocybin. These gummies utilize a proprietary blend of legal tryptamines, nootropics, and adaptogens to mimic Psilocybin’s effects. 

In an effort to create a unique product, Road Trip does not disclose the specific composition of the tryptamines used in their formula.

### **Each Microdose Gummy Contains:**

**Desert Stardust Formula -** This magical ingredient sparks creativity, sharpens focus, and enhances overall well-being. Navigate your day with a subtle shift in perspective, unlocking cognitive and emotional capabilities.

**Lion's Mane -** A natural cognitive enhancer, that empowers you with heightened focus and mental clarity. Rich in compounds that support brain health, fostering increased productivity and sustained energy without the jitters.

**Reishi -** An adaptogen that harmonizes stress, boosts immunity and fights inflammation. Packed with antioxidants, it supports overall well-being, potentially improving cardiovascular health.

**Cordyceps -** This natural powerhouse enhances energy, boosts stamina, and sharpens focus. Say goodbye to fatigue, and seize each moment with vitality.

Each pack contains 20 Orange flavored gummies (4g of equivalent psychedelic effects to dried caps).

***Attention: If you are currently using serotonin-regulating medications such as SSRIs, antidepressants, or similar drugs, please be aware that these gummies may not produce the desired effects. Individuals on such medications have reported feeling little to nothing from these products. Serotonin-regulating medications, like SSRIs, are designed to balance serotonin levels in the body and stabilize mood. Introducing external forms of serotonin, such as through our gummies, may disrupt this balance and increase the risk of interactions, including serotonin syndrome. This warning applies to all similar medications designed to stabilize mood, including MAOIs, SNRIs, and TCAs.***

***Warning and Disclaimer: This product contains Niacin, exceeding the suggested serving size may cause a flushing sensation or warmth, especially in the face, neck, and chest. Consult with a medical professional before use, especially if pregnant or nursing.***
