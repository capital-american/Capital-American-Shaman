# **About Extrax’s Live Sugar THCa Gummies**

Introducing Extrax’s strongest gummies to hit the market - Adios MF!

Each gummy is packed with a powerful blend of Delta-8, Delta-9, THCP, and THCa Live Sugar. With 600mg per gummy, brace yourself for a uniquely powerful experience!

#### **What is THCP?**

Discovered in 2019, THC-P is the latest and greatest in the world of cannabinoids. Boasting a strength known to be 10x stronger than Delta-9 THC, THC-P’s effects are very intense, but also very therapeutic.

#### **What is THCa Live Sugar?**

THCa Live sugar is a concentrate made from hemp or cannabis that contains both THC and terpenes and has become increasingly popular due to its higher potency and ease of use.

When these cannabinoids are combined, users may experience strong psychoactive effects that lead to intense and intoxicating euphoria. This blend can produce unique sensations never felt before, offering a potent and distinctive experience.

#### **Five different flavors to choose from:**

*Blue Razz Bombshell*

*Purple Paradise*
