**Attention: If you are currently using serotonin-regulating medications such as SSRIs, antidepressants, or similar drugs, please be aware that these gummies may not produce the desired effects. Individuals on such medications have reported feeling little to nothing from these products. Serotonin-regulating medications, like SSRIs, are designed to balance serotonin levels in the body and stabilize mood.
