## **WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS & DELTA 9 GUMMIES?**

Delta 9 THC has both varied benefits when used recreationally by most people, especially with gummies as pure and potent as these. Delta 9 THC is the main ingredient in cannabis products used by people who either hold a card for medical cannabis or live in a legal  state.

The most notable benefit of Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the full-bodied feeling it delivers. Lets just say that many people experience an elevated mind after using. Check out some of the benefits that Delta 9 THC may offer:

**\*Mood Boost**

**\*Calmness**

**\*Relief from aches and Pain**

**\*Improved sleep**

**\*Increased appetite**

### Consumer Reported Side Effects

For all the great benefits it offers, Delta 9 THC like all full spectrum cannabinoids (including full spectrum CBD) can still come with potential side effects. Sides are rare and generally do not last long, in most cases a nap will allow you to reset.  Some can experience:

**\*Red Eyes**

**\*Dry mouth**

**\*Paranoia**

### WHY CHOOSE DELTA 9 GUMMIES VS. HHC, THCV, OR DELTA 8 GUMMIES?

Delta 9 legal THC gummies can provide a different experience from gummies made from our other cannabinoids –  THCV, HHC and Delta 8. The best choice really boils down to the person, their goals and how their body reacts to each cannabinoid. Delta 9 tends to be the more potent and intoxicating cannabinoid, slightly more than HHC. So the question becomes – What experience am I looking for?

**What is stronger Delta 8 or Delta 9?**

Most people would describe Delta 9 as being stronger. If you’ve been taking Delta 8 gummies, most users describe Delta 8 THC as the nicer younger sibling – being 60-70% the potency of Delta 9, but both are made from hemp derived thc and the effects vary from person to person.  Some people say Delta 8 THC is as strong as D9.
