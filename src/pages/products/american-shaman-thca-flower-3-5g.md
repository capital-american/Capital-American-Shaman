# About American Shaman THCa Flower

#### **What is THCa?**

Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa) is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp and cannabis. However, when heated, it undergoes a process called decarboxylation and converts to the psychoactive compound THC.

THCa flower is produced by hydroponic growers who use a special enzyme in the nutrients to prevent the conversion of THCa into THC. These growers use popular strains of hemp and make sure that the end product remains within the legal limit of Industrial Hemp, which is less than 0.3% THC by dry weight

#### **A Variety of Strains to Choose from:**

*Tropical Cookies (30.6% THCa)*

*Gelato Mintz (30.4% THCa)*

*Gelato 41 (27.27% THCa)*

*Jealousy (27.2% THCa)*

*Kush Mintz (26.8% THCa)*

*Cereal Killer (26.21% THCa)*

Our THCa flowers are encased in nitrogen-flushed containers, ensuring unparalleled freshness and preservation of aroma and flavor.

Whether you're a connoisseur or new to THCa flowers, our range caters to all, offering an array of sensory experiences to explore and enjoy.
