**MADE IN USA**: These Rapid Dissolve CBD Tablets are a game-changer in being able to provide ease of use and effectiveness.  Each box of these CBD Mints contains 40 tablets that are 15mg Per Tablet. The box contains 600mg of CBD in it with an option for either full spectrum or without THC version ([cbd isolate](https://capitalamericanshaman.com/blog/2020-06-13-full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-isolate/)). 

**Directions:** Place a tablet under your tongue and let it dissolve. The importance of this method of use is the sublingual process that allows the CBD to get directly into your system bypassing the digestive tract.  This allows the effects to be experienced quickly.
