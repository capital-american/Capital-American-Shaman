These Delta-9 THC infused gummies come in four flavors and provide the option to use Delta 9 in one of the most popular forms. 

The four flavors for these D9 gummies are: Watermelon, Strawberry, Blue Raspberry and Sweet Tropical. These Delta 9 THC-infused gummies have 12.5 milligrams of Delta 9 THC per piece (meets the guidelines of <0.3% of Delta 9 THC by weight). While some customers might think 12.5mg is not potent, this is a nano D9 product and it will pack a punch. Our current offering is a 10-piece gummy container giving you a total of 125mg of Delta-9 THC derived from Industrial Hemp. This is for customers that want to experience a psychoactive experience and on its top there is a warning that states: "WARNING: Cognitive And Physical Impairment May Result From The Use Of This Product." We recommend starting with 1/2 a gummy and working up to the full gummy until you're used to it and know your tolerance levels.

**Our Delta 9 THC is Industrial Hemp-Derived and Farm Bill 2018 compliant.**

Onset for these gummies: You should experience effects from these gummies within 30 - 45 minutes due to the fast acting nano D9.

Our current size is 10 count Calyx Container (12.5mg of D9 per piece / 125mg of Delta 9 per container)

Each flavor is in a 10 count, the flavors are: Watermelon, Strawberry, Blue Raspberry and Sweet Tropical

**SUGGESTED USE:**\
