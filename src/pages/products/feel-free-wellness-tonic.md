# About Feel Free Tonic

If you have yet to journey through the world of kava, there are a few basic things that are good  to know. Kava is a plant from the South Pacific. It’s been grown on islands all over the Pacific from Fiji to Hawaii for centuries. Kava plant roots are dried and can be turned into tea or other types of drinks. There are several different species of kava plants and the effects of each differ to a degree.  Some are more calming while others can be more sedating. Historically, many cultures in the region used kava in ceremonies and rituals. It is also use for recreation in social settings.  Over the years not a lot has changed in the ways it’s used.

### Kava for Occasional Anxiety and Relaxation

While kava can be used for many different reasons, more people are turning to kava for occasional anxiety. This is due, largely in part, to the blissful effects of kava. The key compounds in kava are called kavalactones and their effect on your body can yield a feeling of calmness and relaxation. The great thing about Kava is that it is easy to incorporate into your routine. When enjoyed as a beverage like tea or a 2-ounce shot, you get to skip to the experience of well being. Many believe Kava incorporates well to their relaxation routine, whether it’s meditation, exercise, reading, or however you see fit to chill out after a long day.
