Earlybird is an Austin-based recreational hemp company that makes gummies formulated to make you feel good. One of the first companies to formulate a full-spectrum hemp edible with an intentional microdose of natural THC that delivers a consistent, relaxing experience and puts a smile on your face.

All of their gummies contain a 5:1 CBD to THC ratio. With an approximate target of 2.5mg of natural THC and 12.5mg of CBD in each serving, many people find it’s the perfect amount for a consistent and functional way to take the edge off.

If you’re totally new to cannabis or someone who is looking for a mellow re-entry point, this product was developed with you in mind.

**Try all three flavors:** *Watermelon, Lemon and Strawberry.*
