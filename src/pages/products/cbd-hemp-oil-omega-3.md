**MADE IN USA:** Your body’s endocannabinoid system requires omega 3 fatty acids to function optimally. By combining the omega 3 fatty acids with CBD American Shaman’s Full Spectrum Hemp Extract Blend, you are enabling your internal systems to better accept and utilize CBD as Mother Nature intended.

Coromega’s emulsion for omega 3 fish oil has clinically demonstrated a 300% absorption advantage over other fish oil supplements, meaning you get 3x the benefits from a single serving of the pouch. Combine that with CBD and you have a product that efficiently offers benefits to your body’s most important structures.

Each pouch contains precisely 10 mg Full Spectrum Hemp Extract with 1200 mg Omega 3 (EPA + DHA).

**Does Hemp oil have Omegas?**

Hemp oil is considered by some to be the most perfectly balanced oil, since it contains a 3:1 ratio of both the essential fatty acids: Omega 6 -Linoleic Acid (LA) and Omega 3 - Linolenic Acid (LNA). These acids occur naturally in hemp oil because the human body requires fatty acids in order to properly absorb CBD and other cannabinoids through the endocannabinoid system.



**What oil has the most Omega 3?**

Coromega’s omega 3 fish oil has clinically demonstrated a 300% absorption advantage over other fish oil supplements, which means you get 3x the benefits from each serving compared to other omega 3 supplements. Combined with CBD hemp oil, this product efficiently offers benefits to your body’s most important structures, including the endocannabinoid system.



Coromega gets its omega-3 fish oil (in natural triglyceride form) from fish caught in the cold, deep waters of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America. Fish provide a superior source for EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids, and is preferred over plant based sources of ALA. When we consume ALA from seeds or other sources, our bodies must convert ALA to EPA and DHA in order to make use of it. The conversion rate from ALA to EPA/DHA is remarkably low, which is why most experts recommend using marine sources for omega-3. Coromega oil is certified sustainable by Friends of the Sea.
