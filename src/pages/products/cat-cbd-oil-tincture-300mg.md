**What is cat CBD oil?**

CBD is short for cannabidiol, which is a substance that occurs naturally in the cannabis plant. CBD is just one of the cannabinoids found in cannabis, and it’s known for its relief and wellness properties. It is extracted from the hemp plant and diluted with a carrier oil to meet the desired potency. CBD oil works in cats in a similiar fashion to how it does for humans. 

**How does CBD oil for cats work?**

CBD oil works the same way for cats as it does for humans and dogs: by interacting with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Like with humans, the exact effects of CBD can vary from cat to cat since the endocannabinoid system regulates many processes in the body. The fact that the ECS regulates so many parts of the body is the reason CBD can help in so many different ways. Whatever the system needs, CBD cannabinoids can help supplement.

**What are the benefits of CBD?**

The benefits of CBD oil for cats are the same as they are for humans, since cats’ bodies react to CBD the same way human bodies do. CBD oil may help your cat get relief from mild discomfort, promote relaxation, reduce everyday stresses, and provide relief from occasional sleeplessness. It is possible it may provide your cat with positive mental support, help to improve their mood, maintain cardiovascular function, and help promote joint flexibility. These benefits provide cats with helpful support for their bodies and minds as they age.

**What is the difference between CBD oil for cats and CBD oil for humans?**

CBD oil for cats has the same ingredients as CBD oil for humans.  The difference is really only the the flavor! We do not recommend giving our human CBD products to your cat, as it would be difficult to get your cat to eat the flavors of our human products. Our cat CBD oil tincture is real catnip flavor. That way, you can easily get your cat to take their daily serving of CBD!

**Can I give my cat CBD along with other medications?**

CBD oil for cats is not known to cause any issues when combined with other medications, however, you should make sure to consult your veterinarian just in case to make sure your cat won’t experience any issues. They will be able to provide a more personalized professional opinion customized for your pet.
