# **About Enjoy Hemp’s THC + CBD Balanced Syrup**

Find the perfect balance with Enjoy Hemp’s Live Rosin Balance Syrup.

This refreshing Pink Lemonade syrup offers a Hybrid experience with its 1:1 ratio of Delta-9 THC to CBD and is ideal for those seeking the synergistic benefits of both compounds.

CBD is known for its calming, anti-inflammatory, and pain-relieving properties, while Delta-9 THC offers a euphoric and uplifting effect. These two cannabinoids work together to provide a balanced and enhanced experience often referred to as the "entourage effect."

One key benefit of this syrup is its versatility. It can be ingested straight from the bottle or easily incorporated into a variety of beverages—mix it with water, soda, or your favorite cocktail for a customized experience.

This syrup can be a valuable addition to your wellness routine. It can help alleviate stress, reduce pain and inflammation, improve sleep quality, and provide a gentle, uplifting experience. The balanced ratio makes it suitable for daytime or evening use, depending on your needs.

Whether mixed into a beverage or taken on its own, Enjoy Hemp’s Balance Syrup is a delightful treat.
