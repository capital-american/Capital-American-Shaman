# **About 1836 Kratom Texas Red Jumbo Kratom Capsules**

#### **What is Kratom?**

Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is a cousin to the coffee plant, indigenous to Southeast Asia. Traditionally, the leaves have been brewed as a tea and more recently, they have been dried and then crushed or powdered. There are many different strains of kratom that produce different effects.

#### **Why do people use kratom, and is it right for you?**

Many people, including a number of doctors, fitness enthusiasts and health professionals believe kratom to have health benefits including increased energy, focus, relaxation and relief from pain or discomfort.

**Texas Red Kratom -** *A bold, dark red strain, cured in the sunshine but best used at night. After a long day in the saddle, this strain is believed to offer amazing relief from discomfort and provide an enjoyable relaxing feeling. Some prefer this strain to a glass of red wine, as a way to relax without the behavior and calories associated with alcohol. Many athletes love Texas Red at night for rest and recovery.*

***We believe that kratom is best used in moderation. Please consult your physician before using any kratom products.***
