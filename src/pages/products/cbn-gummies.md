**Brand: American Shaman**

We have taken our famous CBNight blend with cannabinol (CBN) and put it in a tasty gummy. Simple and effective, each gummy has 2mg of CBN in it for a perfect serving size of cannabinol to help you get a good night’s rest. It’s recommended that you take your CBN gummy about 30 minutes before bedtime. In the bottle, you’ll get 30 gummies to last you for a whole month of sound sleep & help you find back your perfect circadian rhythm.

Using our Nano technology these gummies work quickly and effectively.  2mg of Nano CBN seems to hit the sweet spot(literally).  Not too little not to much.
