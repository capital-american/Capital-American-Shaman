# About American Shaman THCa infused Prerolls

Experience a new horizon in hemp-based products with the American Shaman **THCa Diamond Infused Pre Rolls**. Featuring our high-quality, industrial hemp strains *Cookies, Northern Lights, Pineapple Express, and Zittlez,* each infused with 99.9% pure THCa diamonds.  These pre rolls offer an unmatched blend of potency and purity.

#### What is THCa?

Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa) is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp. However, when heated, it undergoes a process called decarboxylation and converts to the psychoactive compound THC.

Our pre rolls combine top-shelf CBD or CBG flower with THCa diamonds, creating a synergistic effect that many users find is about twice as potent as the listed percentages suggest.

Each package contains two mini pre rolls, also known as "dog walkers", of half a gram each. The pre rolls are sealed in a child-resistant tube for optimal freshness.

#### A Variety of Strains to Choose from:

*Cookies (9.07% THCa)*

*Northern Lights (8.11% THCa)*

*Pineapple Express (8.83% THCa)*

*Zittlez (7.93% THCa)*

Each strain offers a different terpene profile and cannabinoid content for a variety of experiences.
