## **What does "Nano" mean?**

The word “nano” comes from ancient Greek and means “dwarf.” Scientifically, adding “nano” to a unit of measure means “one billionth.” When added to the word “meter,” as in “nanometer,” the meaning becomes “one billionth of a meter".

 In terms of CBD, the particles have been reduced in size to the point that they can be measured in *billionths* of a meter!  This allows the CBD to be absorbed rather than being processed by our bodies. 

Waht this boils down to is the product being more effective working faster. faster.
