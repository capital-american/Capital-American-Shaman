These gummies bring a new form of CBD to our line of CBD edibles.  They use our proprietary nanotechnology process or putting nano cannabidiol into a tasty gummy.  They come in two flavors with Watermelon and Peach.

As with all of our "Nano" products, they designed to be fast and effective.  These gummies are availible either a 15 or 30 count.

**Ingredients (Peach):**Corn Syrup, Sugar, Water, Gelatin, Citric Acid, Artificial Flavor, Lactic Acid, Pectin, Titanium Dioxide (Color), Yellow 5, Red 40, Hemp Extract (Aerial Parts), Olive Oil, Medium Chain Triglyceride Oil (Coconut), Sorbitan Monostearate, Cannabidiol, Cannabigerol, Ascorbic Acid (Preservative), α-Bisabolol, Terpineol, α-Pinene, Limonene, β-Caryophyllene, Linalool, Humulene.

## **What does "Nano" mean?**

The word “nano” comes from ancient Greek and means “dwarf.” Scientifically, adding “nano” to a unit of measure means “one billionth.” When added to the word “meter,” as in “nanometer,” the meaning becomes “one billionth of a meter".

 In terms of CBD, the CBD particles have been reduced in size to the point that they can be measured in *billionths* of a meter!  This allows the CBD to be absorbed as opposed to being process and then absorbed by our bodies. 

The end result mean we use more of the CBD we consume and it takes effect much faster.
