Odyssey sparkling mushroom elixir is a unique and refreshing drink that combines the benefits of mushrooms with the fizziness of soda.

It is made with organic mushrooms such as lion's mane and cordyceps, which are known for their healing properties and immune-boosting effects. The elixir is also infused with sparkling water, making it a pleasant and enjoyable beverage that can be consumed at any time of the day.

With its low sugar content and natural ingredients, Odyssey sparkling mushroom elixir is a healthy alternative to traditional soda and energy drinks. It is perfect for those who are looking to incorporate more superfoods into their diet without compromising on taste or quality.

Overall, Odyssey sparkling mushroom elixir is more than just a drink, it is a wellness tonic that can nourish both the body and mind.

Cordyceps and lionâ€™s mane extract can invigorate the mind, body, and spirit, providing the same benefits of caffeine without experiencing a crash.

Rich in nootropics, these adaptogenic fungi boost cognitive function and increase clarity and focus while each unique flavor is sure to indulge the senses.

Each can of elixir contains 2,500 mgs of the most potent, bioavailable mushroom extracts as well as 85 mg of organic caffeine from green tea extract for sustained energy throughout the day.
