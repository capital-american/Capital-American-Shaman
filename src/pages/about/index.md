<p><p><p>

I was born and raised in Austin Texas.  I have lived in Austin all but 8 years of my life.  I graduated high school in 1995 and moved to Arlington Texas to attend the University of Texas at Arlington.  I moved back to Austin in 2003 where I would soon find my passion in Real Estate.  Over the next 15 years I worked in the capacity of a Realtor, Real Estate Investor and Home Inspector.

Within my career, which has always centered around Real Estate I have always felt there was something more for me to do.  I truly enjoy the service and interaction with people.  In 2018 I took steps towards venturing into CBD.  I experienced an amazing CBD product from American Shaman and I knew instantly it was something I wanted to be a part of.  I was able to witness drastic improvements in my mom's mobility and discomfort which was confirmation to my vision. I wanted to open a CBD store in the heart of Austin with amazing products.  I envisioned myself helping and assisting those in desire of an excellent natural alternative to pain relief.   

In the time it took Capital CBD American Shaman to come to fruition other CBD stores also popped up all around.  The process of opening the store took longer than expected but the premise of opening a "Wellness Center" never lost it's luster.

The store is a welcoming space for everyone, it's definitely more than a CBD store. We are a wellness center. It's a comfortable environment surrounded with knowledge about the products we are selling. We are backed by the best producer of CBD available. Not all CBD is equal and we can tell you why.

By design our location definitely stands out and is uniquely Austin. It’s hands down Austin’s #1 CBD store.  Stop by and explore our variety of products and let us help customize a regimen to get you on track to live your best life.
